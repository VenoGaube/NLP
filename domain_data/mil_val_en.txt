THE SLOVENIAN ARMED FORCES	14
The development of the defence system will be based on two important assumptions: that efforts by the state and society are essential for the proper organization and preparation of the national defence of the Republic of Slovenia; and that the national defence of the Republic of Slovenia is closely linked to NATO’s collective defence and to mutual assistance within the European Union.
After a period of the easing of tensions in the international security environment, these are increasing once more.
We are facing a transformation in the established international connections and relationships; new dynamics within the existing organizations and mechanisms of the international community; and challenges in the European security architecture, international law, multilateralism, and democratic values.
The impact of climate change is another factor influencing the development of the security situation, while the speed and scale of population movements cause increased epidemiological risks.
All this brings new challenges and requirements for preserving the effectiveness of the defence system.
ILLEGAL MIGRATION
The strategic interests of the Republic of Slovenia are the recognition of and respect for the inviolability of the country's internationally recognized borders and its national territory, including the territorial waters and the airspace of  the Republic of Slovenia; the functioning of the democratic parliamentary political system; respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms; strengthening of the rule of law and the social state; the welfare of its people and a comprehensive development of society; the protection of life and a high level of all forms of security for its people; the protection of the rights and prosperity of Slovenian indigenous ethnic communities in neighbouring countries; peace, security and stability in the world; and the preservation of the environment and natural resources of the Republic of Slovenia.
It respects and shares important values with its allies and partners – respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the strengthening of democracy and the rule of law.
National defence and mutual security assurances
National defence is based on the implementation of military defence and on the implementation of measures to ensure the resilience of society as a whole.
It will also be active in providing assistance in the event of natural and other disasters in these areas.
It will strengthen the efforts to ensure resilience in the south and east of the European Union, a common approach to conflicts and crises, regional cooperation, and inter- national law.
Regional and bilateral cooperation will be an important complement to cooperation in a multilateral context for the Republic of Slovenia.
The Slovenian Armed Forces will be able and prepared to defend and protect the country with its own capabilities and in cooperation with its allies. It will cooperate in ensuring the overall security of the country and its citizens, and  in maintaining and establishing peace, security and stability in the world.
The core of the Slovenian Armed Forces’ capabilities and modernization will be the establishment of the capabilities of a medium battalion battle group.
Its key building blocks will be wheeled armoured vehicles with appropriate firepower, and ballistic and countemine protection of the crew.
It will complement the capabilities of medium infantry, and provide training and operation of the contract reserve component.
The capabilities of special forces will be dedicated to carrying out special reconnaissance tasks, training foreign armed forces, obtaining important military information, and fighting against military objectives in the depths  of the enemy’s territory.
They will provide direct and indirect protection to the Slovenian Armed Forces and critical infrastructure.
Electronic reconnaissance and warfare capabilities will support the implementation of the Republic of Slovenia's defence interests, and protect the Slovenian Armed Forces’ units in the electromagnetic spectrum.
Psychological operations (PSYOPS), civil-military cooperation (CIMIC), and Military Police capabilities will be deployable and will support the operation  of the Slovenian Armed Forces.
Part of the capabilities will be deployable.
They will be based on a comprehensive approach that ensures secure communication channels and the protection of military information systems.
In the development of these capabilities, the Slovenian Armed Forces will be closely involved in NATO and European Union projects.
The Slovenian Armed Forces’ airspace command system will, in the long term, be based on NATO’s air command and control system.
The Airspace Surveillance and Control Centre will be an integral part of NATO's Integrated Air and Missile Defence System.
The system of officer education will be renewed, with entry to the officer corps being made possible chiefly directly after the first level of Bologna education.
Military infrastructure will provide the conditions for operation, training, practice and education.
The infrastructure of the  Slovenian  Armed  Forces will be adapted to the needs of the armed forces, and the development of the defence system.
23
The size of the Slovenian Armed Forces will reflect the real possibilities of the country’s human and economic capabilities, with an enhanced role of the contract reserve component in order to strengthen the country’s defence capacity and resilience.
In the period 2030-2035, the target size of 8,000 members of the active component and 2,000 members of the contract reserve component will be achieved.
8000
The system of training for the members of the contract reserve component to achieve an appropriate and comparable level of competence and training will be re-designed accordingly.
A fundamental challenge with regard to the future development of the Slovenian Armed Forces, the achievement of the development objectives, and its technical modernization, lies in providing a suitable number and quality of personnel.
Measures related to the contract reserve and voluntary military service will be focused on appropriate reimbursements and the motivation of employers for support, timely planning, better earnings, promotion, and so on.
In addition, the system of career development for the members of the Slovenian Armed Forces will be upgraded, providing individuals with the possibilities of career promotion and professional development, and also enabling them to leave at a certain career level.
By signing the Defence Investment Pledge in 2014, the NATO member states committed themselves to halting the trend of declining defence expenditure, and to aiming to gradually increase defence expenditure in real terms, as GDP grows, towards 2% of GDP for defence within the next decade.
0,50 %
Crisis response measures, as part of state preparedness measures, will be supplemented, updated and reviewed accordingly, both in national exercises and in the crisis management exercises of the European Union and NATO.
The applicable international law, rules and norms for the responsible conduct of states in cyberspace are an important factor for reducing risks,  pre- venting conflicts, and establishing trust and stability in international relations.
The communication and information system of the defence system will represent the whole, together with the communication and information system of the Slovenian Armed Forces.
Bearing in mind that cyberspace has no borders and that defence is  our common responsibility, the cyber resilience of our own communication and information systems will be developed, thus providing our contribution to the comprehensive system of national cyber security of the Alliance, in cooperation with other state, public and private, national and international actors.
The establishment of a responsive management system, policies and the organi- zational structure, the introduction of advanced technologies, the development of relevant skills, knowledge, qualifications and awareness, and the enhance- ment of cooperation between national and international actors will contribute to the development of capabilities for protecting communication and informa- tion systems in the field of defence, and responding to cyber threats.
To improve national solutions and activities for raising resilience to hybrid threats through comprehensive and uniform coordination, and the monitoring of hybrid threats in the Republic of Slovenia.
This includes the purchase and modernization of military equipment already held by the Slovenian Armed Forces.
To upgrade strategic communication capabilities in the field of defence.

2.2.4 Values subsystem
7.4 Other non-military forms of defence
In such conditions , other dangers appear that were previously unknown but , just as war , threaten contemporary states .
The interconnectedness of the phenomena cited above demands preventative measures to forestall dangers , and this is possible only through a constant and comprehensive analysis of the circumstances under which it is necessary to seek such solutions , which will be complex and will make possible appropriate and prompt reaction to changes in conditions .
To consistently put into force the responsibility of the competent state agencies for preparing and carrying out civil defence tasks , acknowledging that it is necessary to improve the mechanisms of their management and leadership .
Political or social unrest from countries in the strategic environment could also spread to the Republic of Slovenia ;
3 GOALS AND PRINCIPLES OF CIVIL DEFENCE
Measures for cases of emergency , states of war , crises and market disruptions relate in particular to ensuring the operation of the political system , guiding production and consumption , ensuring the most important services and ensuring communication between the Government , the media and the public .
To protect the functional capacity of the economy and to ensure the operation of economic and other activities , especially those in the areas of industry , power supply , agriculture , traffic , information science and communications , and health ;
The principle of responsibility , which means that , for the planning of preparations and the carrying out of measures of civil defence , the same agency is responsible in war as during peace ;
Civil defence measures must take into account general domestic and international political , economic and other legal conditions and circumstances ;
Civil defence and policy in particular areas of society must be harmonised as much as possible .
The tasks of civil defence in the Republic of Slovenia are thus the following :
To ensure that the public at home and abroad is informed , and to stimulate the motivation for carrying our the defence of the state alongside the simultaneous carrying our of psychological defence measures .
4.2 Jurisdictions
Working duties may be introduced as a general measure or only in individual economic and other activities .
5 ORGANISATION OF CIVIL DEFENCE
For the effective execution of tasks it is necessary to ensure a functional connectedness and harmonisation between economic and other activities defined at individual levels of organisation , and among the activities of civil defence .
This demands quick decision-making from agencies of authority .
The Government holds basic jurisdiction in the management of preparations , organisation and the carrying out of civil defence , and harmonises its organisation and preparations as well as heading the carrying out of civil defence .
During an emergency , state of war , crises or market disruptions , this interdepartmental coordination group would be reshaped into an analysis group at the strategic level with the basic task of analysing the conditions and preparing decisions for the Government .
The success of the majority of measures that are planned in the area of civil defence - and , in particular , psychological defence - depends on public confidence .
It is therefore necessary to carry out activities in the civil defence system in a public , transparent , professional and economical manner .
The carrying out of civil defence measures will represent a significant workload for state and municipal administration , because these tasks will , for the most part , have to be carried out in addition to their regular tasks .
For effective and successful management , and also for the carrying out of the tasks of civil defence , it is necessary to ensure a high level of training for those conducting civil defence .
Within the framework of ensuring the continuity of the authorities during wartime , special attention will be directed to measures for the operation of information and communication systems , especially in work that relates to the realisation of tasks connected with defence and to the enforcement of the rights of citizens in relation to the state , to the rapid and secure exchange of information and to ensuring the safe work of agencies of the authorities .
For the effective management of crises as well as market disruptions and managing defence in an emergency or state of war , a national crisis management centre will begin operating at the Ministry of Defence for the needs of the Government , the national security council and , in war , the national operations defence staff as well .
The principle of effectiveness , which means that the activities must take place in such a way that they realise the anticipated goals to as great an extent possible , with as low costs as possible ;
The planned capacities of civil defence will therefore be continuous and give preference to availability for ensuring defensive needs , whereby it will be kept in mind that capacities intended for supply can quickly change in their volume .
In the economic area there have always arisen more important methods of handling various disruptions that affect market supply .
7.2.2.4 Power supply
To ensure electrical supply to priority users during an emergency , a state of war or market disruptions , suitable measures will be planned , such as ensuring electricity to priority users , isolated operations , and similar measures .
Therefore the basic task of water management is to plan measures to ensure a constant supply of potable water .
People in the Warsaw Pact countries were increasingly dissatisfied ; political systems in Poland , Hungary , Czechoslovakia , Bulgaria and in the German Democratic Republic collapsed .
In Paris , heads of states from 34 member countries of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe signed the Charter of Paris for a New Europe ; this was to help eliminate the post-WWII division of Europe .
With the death of historic leaders such as Tito , Kardelj and others who had managed to keep the situation in the former Yugoslavia under control by means of Party policy , the decisive element of the united country was gone .
In the Serbian Academy of Science and Art Memorandum in 1986 , a clearly nationalistic program for a Greater Serbia was published .
The situation was made worse by the aggressive statements by the Greater Serbia nationalists led by Slobodan Milošević .

Other government positions , which were important in the process of gaining independence , were assigned to members of the democratic coalition . Igor Bavčar was appointed Secretary of Internal Affairs , Janez Janša Secretary of National Defense and Dimitrij Rupel Secretary of Foreign Affairs .
According to some sources , Aksentijević was part of the " long arm " of the YPA counterintelligence service .
The TD HQ staff found themselves in a very difficult position as the majority of them knew that the confiscation of weapons was at odds with the best interests of the Republic of Slovenia .

President Milan Kučan awarded decorations to MSNZ members .
Usually , when there is risk involved and people who are willing to take it , the paramount amount of effort is not seen clearly .
The more successful the outcome , the more perceivable are the results of the risk , and usually everybody would like to take their share of it .
YPA representatives stated that it was only an additional measure to secure the facility .
After the YPA military police broke into the abovementioned headquarters on Prežihova street , the police and territorial defense units subordinate to Major Janez Slapar secured all important facilities .
The unit is in formation and ready for inspection .
Prešeren's poem , " Zdravljica ( the Toast ) " , set to music by Stanko Premrl , had been the anthem of the Republic of Slovenia since 1987 and became the National Anthem in 1990 .
As a consequence , some political parties introduced radical attitudes towards Yugoslavia .
In accordance with the law , the decision had to take effect in six months .
" PREMIK-91 " EXERCISE
Territorial defense units responded to the violent attack .
Preparations for independence also included RS Territorial Defense exercises , one the most important being a tactical exercise , Premik-91 , which was conducted 22 - 24 March 1991 .
The Premik-91 exercise verified that the level of readiness of the RS TD was adequate for it to become the key actor offering armed resistance within the defense system if the freedom , independence and territorial integrity of Slovenia were threatened .

There were many interventions by firefighters .
However , Slovenia did not yield as was expected in Belgrade .
DAY TWO ( FRIDAY , 28 JUNE 1991 )
In the village of Hrastje-Mota , they reached the first obstacle , broke through it and then reached Radenci .
The YPA tank crews , who had been firing while moving , came across a roadblock built from railway cars and set up across the street . They responded with shells .
At the Rožna Dolina border crossing between Nova Gorica on the Slovenian side and Gorizia on the Italian side , 115 YPA troops were posted .
Milan Kučan , the President of the Republic of Slovenia's Presidency , and Admiral Stane Brovet , the Assistant Federal Defense Minister , agreed over the phone to cease hostilities at 9 : 00 p.m.
Škofljica during the war
From Friday night to Saturday morning , a meeting between Slovenian representatives , three representatives from the European Community and the Chairman of the Federal Executive Council was held in Zagreb .
During the War for Slovenian Independence , medical institutions played an important role by generously providing care for the wounded on both sides - for both TD and YPA troops .
The alarm was cleared only after a full hour .
Although neither side revoked the ceasefire , there were constant violations .
The YPA often misused Red Cross signs to fire from helicopters . The helicopters were also frequently used to transport military equipment , soldiers , ammunition and signals assets .
The first attack on the Kum transmitter was conducted on Friday , 28 June , around 2 p.m.

Slovenian members of the Yugoslav Aviation Group , Major Jože Kalan and Senior Master Sergeant Bogomir Šuptar , accomplished a brave feat during the War for Slovenian Independence .
Using a well-prepared and detailed plan , they managed to transport a " Gazelle " helicopter to the Slovenian side .
Prisoners of war ( POWs ) are typical in wars where the warring parties come in direct contact with each other and capture members from the enemy side .
On 29 June , the Republic Coordination Group issued an order to Internal Affairs authorities to set up temporary concentration camps for POWs in coordination with TD forces .
The majority of YPA troops were at the posts , in trenches and in their positions .
In the evening of the same day , the Yugoslav Defense Minister , Veljko Kadijević , appeared on the Belgrade television channel .
In his emotional address , he made several serious accusations against and reproachful remarks about Slovenes . He also made it clear that political means were the only instruments for resolving the disputes .
The strain and fatigue were immense .
Part of the agreement was also the quick establishment of an international observers ' commission .
FAREWELL WITHOUT TEARS
The YPA took the majority of its assets and left only a minor portion in Slovenia .

Also , we enhanced our participation in international operations . At the beginning of last year , the first SAF contingent was deployed to Afghanistan and our contingent in the Kosovo KFOR mission was increased .
Increased financial allocations for applied research and development projects and technological development enabled considerable progress to be made in comparison with 2003 .
Our future priorities will be the adoption of proper foundations to assist the formation of a strong crisis management system .
We believe that we managed to build a structure that will not need major changes in the future .
The FCSAF comprises two brigade level commands , the 1st and the 72nd Brigades and the Support Command ( SC ) at the regimental level .
KEY RESULTS IN 2004
The SC commands six military territorial commands , the logistic battalion , the air base , the Military Medical Service and units stationed in military posts .
After this transformation , the SAF have an affordable and smaller structure .
The NATO Central Registry provides guidelines for all sub-registries and control points in Slovenia .
Based on the SDR findings , a General Long-term Plan for the Development and Equipping of the SAF was drafted . It set new guidelines for the development of the armed forces for the period up to 2015 , taking into account the changed security environment , the results of defence reform implementation and integration into NATO and the EU.
In July 2004 , this plan was adopted by the National Assembly .
As a reliable member of the international community and as a NATO member , Slovenia is ready to operate also in other crisis areas .
In addition to official confirmation on the willingness for future deployment of the MLF in Kosovo PSO , decisions were made on priority tasks related to the future of the MLF , as follows :
This ordinance gives a new definition of organisational units responsible for the assignment of citizens in the system of protection against natural and other disasters , the authority and criteria for the assignment and the proposal procedure for the assignment of citizens on duties .
The provisions on the cancellation of assignment were also changed .
In accordance with new regulations , contract reserves and employers are required to find an agreement on the training schedule and on its changes . The employers , on the other hand , can request from the responsible authority a postponement of training for a given contract reservist if there is urgent work that must be done and if they have no suitable replacement for them .
2.3.2 Improved SAF capabilities
In addition , we increased transfer capabilities of the backbone network and installed additional safe back-up paths .
In relation to intelligence and security activities in the SAF , we endorsed normative acts that are required for the centralisation of professional management of the intelligence and security bodies and military police , and identified mutual cooperation with the MOD Intelligence and Security Service ( ISS ) .
In 2004 , we continued to increase the active component and the contract reserve and to downsize the compulsory reserve .
The administrative authority responsible for defence affairs enters the conscripts in military records and informs them about their rights and obligations , usually in the calendar year in which they reach 18 years .
We prepared and validated unit training cycles that determine unit training for several years in advance and delegated to commanders additional training authorities .
We proceeded with training for candidates doing their voluntary military service and contract reserves .
There are plans to add to the training scope of these two categories of personnel .
2.4 International operations
NATO operations
Currently , there are 32 SAF service members deployed to Kosovo .
EU operations
At the end of 2004 , there were 182 SAF service members involved in EUFOR .

According to the exercise scenario there was a traffic accident that resulted in a major hazmat spillage and the pollution of the Drava river .
Within the Target Research Programme ( TRP ) , Slovenia's Competitiveness 2001-2006 , tasks were carried out related to land slides and avalanches and the impact of climatic change on natural disasters .
In the area of fire safety we verified the GIS model for wildfire threats ; tested construction material characteristics and methods for safe object design ; analysed fire safety measures and control , the efficiency of tunnel incident response and the water supplies for fire fighting ; analysed fire safety measures in buildings in terms of fire safety and cost-effectiveness ; and carried out education and training programmes for fire fighting formations chiefs .
We started with the technological development of equipment to improve fire safety in the Karst area , the priority being on the development of vehicles and equipment for wildfire interventions .
This provides us with a better selection of service providers for the transfer of data necessary for public alarm systems and reduces the costs .
We trained units responsible for the provision of food and two signal squads .
2.6.3 International cooperation in the area of protection against natural and other disasters
In the area of civil defence , administrative and subject-matter defence issues , the main concern for inspections was verifying defence preparations in several administrative units , municipalities and regional and branch defence offices .
In regional and branch defence offices , inspections were related to human resources management procedures , voluntary military service , military service of contract reservists and preparations for re-introduction of military duty .
One of the inspections concentrated on the status of the Basic Development Programmes project .
Civil defence
In 2004 , 3,650 inspections were conducted , the largest part in companies , institutions and other organisations . The smallest number of these inspections were completed in the Ministries and other government agencies .
2.11 NATO and EU document management
Pooling of scientific resources available in the market was carried out , which created conditions for tendering procedures in the field of scientific and research projects .
Criteria related to military duties outside the military were redefined . With the aim of eliminating any further personnel discrepancies within the military , the present law foresees the termination of work contracts in the defence area at the end of the calendar year for military personnel fulfilling the requirements to become entitled for age retirement , irrespective of the time of concluding their employment contract . This clause is dependant upon the final decision by the Constitutional Court concerning constitutional rights .

? equipping combat units and enhancing command and control capabilities ,
The implementation of these projects necessitates additional equipping for SAF units and service members , improved combat capabilities and the possibility of utilising these assets for protection and rescue purposes .
All of the tasks concerning collection , processing and distribution of data on spatial planning , and the development and maintenance of the geographic information system ( GIS ) were accomplished .
4.1 Integration into NATO
The MOD contributes personnel to 114 major NATO working bodies composed of several subordinate organisations .
The MOD monitors activities related to European security and defence , and operations by the EU Council ( GAERC ) , COREPER and the Political and Security Committee ( PSC ) .
Slovenia is actively involved in international community endeavours for the stabilisation and development of this region and will remain engaged as part of the EU-led ALTHEA operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina after the conclusion of NATO operation SFOR .
State Secretaries also participated in various bilateral activities , with defence and political consultations with the Slovak and Swedish State Secretaries of the respective Defence Ministries occupying a central position .
Together with the US European Command ( EUCOM ) , the MOD co-organised a South Eastern Europe Clearinghouse Conference ( SEEC ) which was held from 30 November to 1 December 2004 in Ljubljana .

Minister's address
The effectiveness of the defence reforms and the systematic transformation of the Slovenian Armed Forces into a professional force depend on sufficient financial resources being made available . Similarly important is functional professionalisation which requires a holistic and coherent structure relating to organisation , processes , values and motivation .
As the Strategic Defence Review is successfully brought to a conclusion , the necessary defence reforms must now take a place .
The main goal of the defence reforms is to form and provide trained , motivated , combat-ready and interoperable defence forces which , under clear leadership that is change-oriented and based on knowledge , experience and positive tradition , supplemented by modern doctrine and technology , will effectively pursue clear strategic goals .
2. The strategic assessment of the security environment dictates the need for a security and defence policy that will form a suitable basis for the effective operation of the defence system , and the SAF in particular , in preventing and managing crises and conflicts , and also the basis for activities within alliances and coalitions .
3. With a view to strengthening national security and reducing exposure to risks , Slovenian defence policy is oriented towards an active and constructive role , particularly within the various bodies of the United Nations , NATO and the European Union .
Also introduced were contractual reserves , which in accordance with the legislation will continue to be supplemented with compulsory reserves until 2010 at the latest .
Following the end of the cold war era , with an increasing trend towards the demilitarisation of the sources of threat , it has been the social and economic aspects of security that are becoming increasingly important to the preservation of general ( national ) security .
General technological advancement , and in particular the development of digital technology , over the last twenty years has dictated the transition from an industrial society to an information society in which new forms of communication , business , management , education and training are being introduced .
All social systems and the whole of public life are becoming vitally dependent on information technology .
Theatres of war have become digitalised , and weapons systems are increasingly automated .
2.4 Political environment
Because of the complexity and unpredictability of the sources of threat and the limited nature of national resources , in the future political and security environment countries will be increasingly compelled to strengthen international cooperation and integration in the fields of security and defence .
Although questions are often asked about its effectiveness and the need for reform , its size in terms of membership and the nature of the tasks it carries out make the UN an invaluable organisation .
Changing political and security circumstances mean NATO too is undergoing intensive change .
The role and significance of the military environment have changed greatly since the end of the bipolar global division .
Only multipurpose security and defence forces will be able to adapt rapidly to the changing content and dynamics of developments in the security environment .
In the future SAF units will have to be capable of integrated operation in the international environment .
Slovenia recognises that its small size and limited resources mean that it cannot on its own guarantee an effective and self-sufficient national security system , and therefore it strengthens it through integration in collective security and collective defence systems .
to ensure national integrity and prosperity by means of an active role in the international community and in the globalised world
cooperation in the OSCE and , in particular , in the UN which , as well as ensuring national security , also makes an important contribution to protection of human rights , respect for international law , ensuring international economic and social development , protection of natural resources and reducing class divisions in society
As part of the national security policy , the defence policy of the Republic of Slovenia comprises plans , programmes and activities enabling the defence of the state using the country's own defence capabilities and in cooperation with Allies .
Slovenian defence policy today is determined by three factors :
In the 21st century the United Nations will continue to have an important role and importance in preserving international peace and security .
UN-led peace support operations are taking on a new image as the UN is increasingly becoming involved in conflict prevention operations comprising both political and military activities .
Slovenia will maintain defence spending at a level which will ensure continued implementation of defence reforms and restructuring and modernisation of the armed forces , and enable an appropriate level of investment in the modernisation of equipment and infrastructure .
3.2.1.4 OSCE
At the 5th ministerial meeting , Ministers adopted guidelines on the main areas of cooperation in CENCOOP , which envisage the formation of a unit from the CENCOOP member states to be deployed on peacekeeping operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina .
This cooperation is proceeding in the spirit of the Partnership for Peace programme and is promoting the inclusion of the countries of South-East Europe in Euro-Atlantic integrations .
Since 2002 Slovenia has also had observer status in the Satellite Interconnection of Military Hospitals ( SIMIHO ) project .
Procedures for the ratification of the Open Skies Treaty will continue .
Medium-term planning is also being put in place as a basis for preparation of personnel plans , training plans and planning for development , equipping and procurement of military equipment .
The forthcoming period will be characterised by a reduction in conventional military threats , with warning times being greatly increased .
Depending on the trends in this strategic environment , the capabilities and available resources , the SAF must be capable of adapting its scale and structure to these changes and of fulfilling the country's international commitments .
The inclusion of new activities within the SAF's mission and tasks requires an appropriate organisation and flexibility on the part of the SAF .
4.2 Security policy of the Republic of Slovenia
These procedures will also take account of the experience and recommendations from defence planning in NATO and from defence capability planning in the EU.
In the future the manning system in the SAF will continue to be based on a professional army , contractual military service in the reserve forces and voluntary military service .
Eliminating the personnel disparities in terms of education , rank and age that have accumulated over ten years in the development of the defence system is one of the priority tasks in the coming years .
This situation will be dealt with by 2010 .
Finance
By 2015 the capabilities of the SAF will be based on the ability to form two combined tactical defence units and the ability to set up a mobilisation base for formation of an appropriate number of tactical defence units .
This purpose is being realised partly through the Slovenia's inclusion and active cooperation in international security integrations based on international treaties .
From the purpose of the SAF we can derive its missions as follows :
Prevention of any aggression and adequate response in case it should occur :
collective defence ( Article 5 of the Washington Treaty ) , fight against international terrorism and other threats to peace .
armaments supervision and disarmament , inspection of other nations ' military units at their location , verification activities .
The possibility of integrating computer assisted training and operations at the brigade or higher level of command will also be ensured .
5.4 Key challenges
The challenges in the personnel field will relate to the skill levels and the psychophysical abilities of people wishing to become professional soldiers , junior officers and officers , as well as continuing education and individual and collective training .
The changed and expanded tasks of the SAF will require professional , motivated individuals and units .
This applies in particular to areas representing systems multipliers ( use of modern technology in the entire area with emphasis on the command and control system , the military intelligence system , air defence as a whole and logistics ) .
The scale of operations is important as far as development of capabilities is concerned . Taking into account the size of the SAF and their planned key capabilities and the forces for participation in international operations , the scale of SAF contribution to operations could be as follows :
large-scale with a battalion tactical group
very large-scale with all the forces which Slovenia will have at its disposal to prevent threats within the framework of national defence , or all the forces which will be available for defence of the Alliance .
These are :
Sustainability of forces
Availability of forces
is the capacity and readiness of forces to carry out tasks under certain conditions in a specific time frame and with the necessary resources being secured .
Combat effectiveness
will be ensured through modernisation of combat and non-combat systems and use of new technologies which will be introduced in line with adopted priorities .
združljiv je z zavezniki , je zelo hiter in zmogljiv in ima visoko sposobnost preživetja .
will be ensured by the introduction of NATO standards in the area of organisation , work methods and compatibility of equipment .
The operational development of capabilities will be aligned with the Alliance and presented cyclically ( every two years ) in the mid-term defence programme .
SAF capabilities in 2015 .
Schools and other institutions will be set up within the DDETC to carry out all types of military education and training , from basic training to general staff and specialist training , for soldiers , junior officers , officers and military officials and civilians employed in the SAF .
In addition , the MTCs will partly serve as contact points between the SAF and civil defence components . They will develop concept of building up SAF capabilities ( the third circle ) which represent the specific manning structure that can be included in the wartime structure , in accordance with the law .
The key challenges for achieving the planned capabilities of the SAF will be linked to real and timely preparation and implementation of adopted plans .
The realisation of planned capabilities will require full use being made of the Allies ' experience so as to rationalise and shorten the time needed to develop capabilities .
The national security strategy stipulates that Slovenia will connect the elements of the national security system into an effective crisis management system which will be capable of operating in the security efforts of our country and the international community to resolve complex modern crises .
to provide information to the public at home and abroad and to encourage motivation to carry out national defence at the same time as carrying out psychological defence measures .
In certain areas crisis management agencies have already been set up , or their establishment is envisaged at the first symptoms of a crisis ( e.g. in the areas of internal affairs and military defence ) .
For the purpose of ensuring that effective action is taken in the event of a crisis , a National Crisis Management Centre ( NCMC ) has been set up to ensure the spatial , organisational , technical and other conditions for the government to act rapidly and effectively , for the related coordination of work between the various bodies and organisations participating in crisis management and for the rapid , reliable and safe flow of information and support for management at the strategic level .
The role of the National Security Council ( NSC ) , the highest consultative and coordinating body of the government , in preventing the emergence of crisis situations and acting effectively in the event that a crisis arises will be further strengthened .
The following basic principles will be followed in planning the preparation and implementation of civil defence and crisis management measures :
The development of an effective crisis management system also requires a system of comprehensive and ongoing assessment of national security threats to be put in place as soon as possible and to include the area of military and asymmetric threats .
In these tasks the ISS participates within its competence with all the other parts of the national security system and , on the basis of mutual interest , also with foreign military or defence intelligence and security services .
With inclusion in NATO and the EU the ISS will take on new tasks and responsibilities in the area of intelligence , counterintelligence and security activities for defence requirements in the system of collective defence and the common foreign and security policy .
The multi-layered and multi-dimensional security challenges , risks and threats in the region , in Europe and around the world give rise to many uncertainties as far as guaranteeing national and international security is concerned .
Therefore the organisational , personnel and material foundations will be put in place for cooperation and for the exchange of intelligence and security information at the national level ( and institutionalised where necessary ) as part of bilateral cooperation and within the framework of alliances .
Such alternative approaches and strategies will enable intermediate system models to be set up that will allow logistics to operate in a stable and efficient manner at a given level of development .
9.3 Key development challenges and goals
Therefore communications and information systems for NATO are one of the typical and priority areas . This equipment requires better basic training on the part of our own personnel as well as broader and longer-term cooperation with commercial organisations providing supplementary know-how and services .
Information support to SAF operations comprises the development of management , command and control systems , i.e. a communications and information system which combines a connected set of information and communications capabilities , associated processes and the personnel who manage and provide information on request to combatants , commanders and support staff .
10 Human resource management
The growth in the number of employees in the SAF is part of the implementation of the project to professionalise the army .
There are too few soldiers and too many officers compared to the wartime strength target structure .
seeking suitable positions for employees through the internal labour market in the bodies of the national administration
For the purpose of finding possibilities for the transfer of employees from the MoD , a special working group was set up with the Ministry of the Interior which is intensively studying the possibility of staff transfers from the MoD to the police .
The personnel function must gradually be transformed into part of the human resource and human capital management process .
a project will be elaborated for development of senior personnel and management staff in the area of defence and crisis management
a system of annual appraisal interviews , systematic encouragement of innovation , an evaluation system using the 360ş method , e-education , individual annual work plans , education , promotion and the concept of a " learning system " will all be introduced
11 Organisational structure of the MoD
Defence Affairs Directorate with the following organisational units :
Finance Sector
a reduction in the number of agencies involved and hence in the scale of defence preparations
Intensive changes in the scale and structure of the SAF and its missions and tasks consequently require a change in the organisational structure of the MoD .
Solutions from abroad cannot simply be transferred into our system , some of whose individual solutions are in themselves quite unique .
Until further notice they will also carry out tasks connected with the compulsory reserve , with the reduction in the wartime strength of the SAF and management of administrative procedures related to defence duties .
The other part of the defence system , under the responsibility of the MoD , will ensure full support to the SAF in achieving the final capabilities of units and commands .
THE CIVIL DEFENCE DOCTRINE OF THE
The Civil Defence Doctrine proceeds from the Resolution on the National Security Strategy of the Republic of Slovenia ( Uradni list RS , 56/01 ) and the Defence Strategy of the Republic of Slovenia ( Government of the RS , no .
It is based upon up-to-date scientific understandings regarding the organisation and tasks of civil defence and , at the same time , on the tradition of civil defence in the territory of Slovenia .
On the basis of new circumstances in the narrower and broader security environments , and taking into account the strategic interests of the Republic of Slovenia that it be included in NATO and the European Union , the Doctrine establishes new frameworks for planning and carrying out civil defence preparations in the Republic of Slovenia .
These are constant population growth , the effect of industrialisation on the environment , uncertainty regarding finding reliable sources of energy in the future , the vulnerability of information and communication systems , the problems of agricultural production and supplies , unstable international credit and financial markets , commercial conflicts , and similar issues .
In this , it is necessary to direct particular attention to crises and military threats to the Republic of Slovenia ;
Among the preventative measures that are planned and carried out during peacetime are , in particular , organisational , personnel , material , legal and other preparations for the operation of civil defence ; the working out of defence plans ; ensuring a work force ; the formation of leadership mechanisms ; the harmonisation of planned civil defence measures ; the formation of stockpiles of important goods for defence , supplying the population and the economy ; the formation of suitable information systems for supporting decision-making and the training of those that will carry out activities in the area of civil defence .
In the area of provisions for state agencies and agencies of local self-administration , the goals of civil defence are :
To ensure effective support in carrying out military defence ;
The tasks of civil defence in the Republic of Slovenia are thus the following :
It is particularly important that the jurisdictions among those carrying out the preparations for civil defence be clear and demarcated , which is a precondition for the effective operation of state agencies , local self-government , and companies and institutes , as well as economic and other activities during an emergency , a state of war , crises and market disruptions .
The general principle is that , as a rule , agencies at the state level , in particular the Government of the Republic of Slovenia ( hereinafter :
6 ADMINISTRATION AND LEADERSHIP OF CIVIL DEFENCE
Such groups can also be formed in other state agencies , the state administration's agencies of territorial organisation , local communities and in companies , institutes and other organisations whose activity is of particular significance for defence .
As part of the management of civil defence , the Government has a key supervisory role . It realises this through the supervision of the competent ministries in the carrying out of specific tasks and measures or through indirect monitoring of reports and information from the competent ministries and government services and the acceptance of necessary measures for improving the situation .
Civil defence is not a closed and isolated system , but functions within society and , for the most part , publicly .
Because all civil defence activities contribute to the realisation of the basic goals and tasks of the defence system , it is necessary that there be a close harmonisation among them , especially between civil and military defence on the one hand , and among the individual activities of civil defence on the other .
Harmonisation is also carried out during the preparations for , as well as the carrying out of , civil defence measures .
This means that preparations for civil defence in individual activities are carried out only to the most necessary extent , and in the case of a security deterioration in the political situation they can be strengthened .
Measures for preserving the continuity of the authorities are planned only for the case of war .
Preserving the freedom of decision making and of the action of agencies of authority both within the state and in the international community ;
7.2 Economic defence
7.2.1 Support for military defence
7.2.1.1 Civil defence cooperation in international peacekeeping operations
Regardless of the fact that the tasks of civil defence in this area are relatively new elsewhere around the world and that there is not yet sufficient experience , an appropriate concept will be prepared that will facilitate the carrying out of tasks in this area .
The principle of effectiveness , which means that the activities must take place in such a way that they realise the anticipated goals to as great an extent possible , with as low costs as possible ;
One of the chief goals of preparation for military defence is also ensuring an appropriate level of interoperability with NATO in the area of logistics .
This is an important point of departure , because it also defines the tasks and activities of civil defence in this area .
Measures restricting consumption will be planned in a flexible manner , adapted to the situation at hand , and will not be aimed at curtailing the trade cycle .
Measures will be especially planned to ensure cooperation between state agencies and the Slovenian Armed Forces .
Such attacks could have serious consequences for the operation of the country as a whole .
7.2.2.4 Power supply
In the area of energy , the Republic of Slovenia is entirely dependent on the import of petroleum , natural gas and uranium oxide .
It would likewise be advantageous , particularly in the most pressing cases , to renovate existing and construct alternative power lines , especially from Primorska to Ljubljana .
In an emergency , a state of war or market disruptions , the preservation of industrial production is of special significance , because many of them can contribute to the support of defence , enable supply to other economic branches and the population , and ensure the operation of workplaces as well .
A characteristic of Slovenian agriculture is that it is quite fractured , which reduces harvests and increases costs .
During wartime health care must also carry out additional tasks , especially health care for the members of the Slovenian Armed Forces .
It will be necessary to direct work in this area to preventative and curative efforts , in which it is necessary to plan so that , especially in wartime , the extent of social protective activities will increase significantly .
The principle of trust and mutual cooperation between the state and the media ;
The principle of professionalism .
The Doctrine is the foundation for the preparation of doctrines in this area that will , in accordance with needs , more precisely define doctrinal solutions connected to the preparation and carrying out of civil defence in individual economic and other activities .

The year 1989 saw dramatic changes in Eastern Europe . These changes also had a major impact on the situation in the former Yugoslavia and in Slovenia .
People in the Warsaw Pact countries were increasingly dissatisfied ; political systems in Poland , Hungary , Czechoslovakia , Bulgaria and in the German Democratic Republic collapsed .

In the summer of 1988 , the trial against the four was conducted at the courthouse on Roška street in Ljubljana .
At the end of 1989 , the opposition parties united as the Democratic Opposition of Slovenia or DEMOS . Jože Pučnik was elected President of DEMOS .
Their position was that sovereignty belonged to a nation rather than to a federation .
The negative response by the federal leadership and the majority of the republics made Slovenian national and political unity even stronger .
The emergence of democratic parties in the first half of 1989 ( SKZ , SDZ , SDZS , ZS , and KSG ) was a clear sign of political pluralism in Slovenia .
The public protest gathering was at the Kongresni trg square in Ljubljana .
In November 1990 , the Yugoslav Communist Association , a movement for Yugoslavia , was established and was mainly comprised of YPA servicemembers . The Yugoslav Communist Association had no significant impact on later developments in Yugoslavia .
Other government positions , which were important in the process of gaining independence , were assigned to members of the democratic coalition . Igor Bavčar was appointed Secretary of Internal Affairs , Janez Janša Secretary of National Defense and Dimitrij Rupel Secretary of Foreign Affairs .

The more successful the outcome , the more perceivable are the results of the risk , and usually everybody would like to take their share of it .
OCCUPATION OF THE REPUBLIC TERRITORIAL DEFENSE HEADQUARTERS
On 4 October 1990 at 2230 hours , a military police unit from the Šentvid military post broke into the Territorial Defense Headquarters located in Ljubljana at Prežihova 4.
The Republic Secretariat for National Defense was protected by MORiS members wearing new uniforms made in the Kočevje firm OPREMA and armed with MGV machine guns .
On 28 September 1990 , the Presidency appointed reserve Major Janez Slapar the new Acting Chief of the Slovenian Territorial Defense Headquarters .
On 2 October , the SFRY Presidency decided that the Commander of the 5th Military District in Zagreb would take over the command of the Slovenian Territorial Defense .
On this occasion , Janez Slapar said , " The sooner the YPA recognizes the new TD HQ , the easier finding a solution to the conflict will be . "
The unit is in formation and ready for inspection .
In the fall of 1990 , Slovenia proposed to the Federation and all the republics that an agreement on confederation be signed .
A mixture of radicalism on the part of DEMOS , which was constantly reminding Yugoslavia that in the long run changes could not be prevented , and the expected reserved posture by the political parties from the previous system bore results .
The exercise objectives were to carry out mobilization in order to verify the tactical operations of TD units during attack following a movement to contact and counter-commando combat .
THE DECLARATION OF AN INDEPENDENT AND SOVEREIGN REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA , LJUBLJANA , 26 JUNE 1991
The celebration at which a huge crowd of people had gathered ended with fireworks and the chiming of bells . There were also bonfires on the tops of neighboring hills .

Tanks and armored vehicles from Maribor approached the border crossings with Austria while the Varaždin-based tank convoy , under the command of Colonel Popov , attempted to force its way through Ormož .
It seemed as if nothing else could have stopped the tanks ' progression .
A YPA armored convoy tried to move past Novo mesto towards Ljubljana to reach its final destination at the Brnik Airport .
" According to the assessment of the Presidency , the maneuvers of YPA units-the message from the 5th military district-can be regarded as violent and ruthless actions by the Yugoslav Army , an act of aggression against the independence and sovereignty of the Republic of Slovenia and an attempt to permanently occupy Slovenia .
In the morning at approximately ten o'clock , the TD attacked a column of armored vehicles after a series of unsuccessful negotiations .
The first shot came from the YPA sentry box on the border ; this was then followed by the response from the TD and police forces .
