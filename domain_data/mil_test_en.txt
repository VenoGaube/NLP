Dear Readers,
The purpose of the Defence White Paper is to define a gradual long-term development of the Republic of Slovenia’s defence system in order to ensure the necessary levels of capacity and preparedness for the implementation of national defence, and the fulfilment of the adopted international obligations.
Without it, other national objectives relating to social, economic, political and cultural develo- pment and the well-being of individuals and the state cannot be achieved.
No part of Europe is safe from contemporary threats.

The Paper explains the policy framework and commitments for adapting the defence system to changes in the security environment. It takes into account the measures to strengthen Slovenia’s defence capacity, which were proposed in the Strategic Defence Review 2016, and in NATO’s defence planning and capabilities assessments and other findings on the condition of the defence system.
It recognizes the effects of the deterioration in the security environment, the emergence of new technological trends, and demographic trends in the Republic of Slovenia and abroad.
It expresses the determination of the Republic of Slovenia to strengthen its defence system, and stresses the need for the implementation of measures in the field of defence.
The unfavorable long-term demographic trends in the Republic of Slovenia and abroad;
development of defence capacity in the past.
The defence system of the Republic of Slovenia will provide the necessary level of competence, preparedness, resilience, and sustainability of defence capacity, and will contribute to the overall resilience of the state and society  to respond to contemporary and future security challenges and threats.
The updated strategic and planning guidelines and normative bases will provide the Slovenian Armed Forces with system, status, financial, material, human resource, doctrinal, and other conditions for its development and the provision of necessary readiness.
Technological advances and the availability of knowledge, products, and technologies to state and non-state actors have a significant influence on the development of security threats, which may in turn influence the emergence of  new security challenges in new domains of operation.
The Defence White Paper of the Republic of Slovenia focuses on the introduction of a wide range of measures for the organizational, human resources, material, and technological moder- nization of the defence system.
In order to achieve these objectives it is of primary importance to gain a broad social understanding of the changing security environment and the associated risks of the operation and develo- pment of the Republic of Slovenia in the long term, which requires a responsive and functioning defence system.
HYBRID OPERATION
The defence system of the Republic of Slovenia will support lasting and strategic national interests which will enable the creation of a safe environment as a condition for the welfare  of the state, society, and citizens.
A responsive and effective national defence is the cornerstone of a sovereign state in ensuring its security and defence.
The most important element of national defence is sufficient investment in the development of the national defence capacity based on the national planning priorities, NATO's defence planning process, and defence planning within the European Union.
This includes the appropriate  size,  structure,  equipment,  and  capabilities  of  its  military  and  civilian defence capacity.
As a member of NATO, the Republic of Slovenia receives security assuran- ces and accepts commitments, since NATO's collective defence is based on a sufficient range of the Allies' national capabilities.
Involvement in the collective defence system allows for a more rational development of Slovenia’s own defence capacity.
A responsive and effective national defence is the cornerstone of a sovereign state in ensuring security and defence
NATO’s collective defence and mutual assistance within the EU
The Republic of Slovenia has committed itself to a gradual long-term approximation to a defence spending target of 2% of GDP within broad fiscal frameworks, and a defence investment share of 20% of defence spending, with an intermediate target of 1.5% of GDP by 2024.
the importance of NATO's collective defence, in line with the negative changes in the international security environment.
Participation of the Slovenian Armed Forces in international operations and missions, and in NATO and European Union response forces, will remain an important factor in achieving responsiveness and a higher level of competence, efficiency and interoperability of forces.
The Republic of Slovenia will contribute to ensuring the common defence of its territory, people and values by participating in the basic tasks of the Alliance, such as collective defence, crisis management and cooperative security.
The commitment of the Republic of Slovenia to the North Atlantic Treaty will be manifested through joint contribution to the deterrence and  collective defence measures, contribution to response forces, and participation in exercises and other activities to ensure preparedness for various security challenges and threats, taking into account the sustainability of forces and their capabilities.
Close involvement of members will be important in the development of defence capacity and permanent structured cooperation, the fulfilment of commitments to mutual assistance and solidarity, response to hybrid ope- rations, and cooperation with NATO in the development of capabilities and activities in crisis areas.
A cohesive and credible European Union strengthens NATO's European pillar as the foundation of Europe's collective defence and transatlantic ties, and enhances the role of the European Union as a global security and defence actor.
The mission of the Slovenian Armed Forces is to deter military aggression against the Republic of Slovenia independently and in cooperation with its allies, and to contribute to international peace and stability both within and outside the Alliance’s borders.
The modern security environment requires the Slovenian Armed Forces to increase its ability to operate in various security, military and defence scenarios across the entire spectrum of operations; increase its level of readiness; and increase the resilience and sustainability of military capabilities.
Vision for the development of the Slovenian Armed Forces
The ability and readiness of the Slovenian Armed Forces will be based on trained and skilled soldiers, competent leaders, quality equipment, high-level commands and units, and the ability to adapt to the complex security envi- ronment.
The following development objectives will need to be met to achieve this vision:
Strengthening of technologically advanced military capabilities as a force multiplier;
– The fulfilment of international commitments of the Republic of Slovenia relating to the establishment of agreed military capabilities, to military  con- tribution to international operations and missions, to response forces, and to the provision of financial resources;
Upgrading of the system of recruitment, retention and exit of members of the Slovenian Armed Forces;
Establishment of conditions for increasing the contract reserve component and the voluntary military service;
Strengthening of the connection of the Slovenian Armed Forces to the local environment in the wider area of the Republic of Slovenia;
Strengthening of the connection of the Slovenian Armed Forces to other national security subsystems.
Certain capabilities will not be developed by the Slovenian Armed Forces on  its own, but will be provided within the Alliance or jointly through appropriate agreements with individual allied or partner countries.
Financial resources will be primarily devoted to launching major modernization projects and to infrastructure capabilities of the Slovenian Armed Forces.
To this end, appropriate legislation will be prepared for the implementation of  key equipping projects of the Slovenian Armed Forces.
4.2.1	Combat capabilities
These capabilities will be based on self-propelled artillery systems with digitized and networked systems for fire control and long-range operations.
They will be equipped with modern portable and mobile anti-tank weapons.
They will provide capabilities for the medium battalion battle group.
Military intelligence and reconnaissance capabilities will be used for reconnaissance, observation, targeting, data collection and analysis, and the provision of intelligence.
The deployability of the Slovenian Armed Forces will be based on land, maritime and air strategic transport, which will be provided through various initiatives by NATO and the European Union, and by contractors.
4.2.4	Military aviation capabilities
The command and control system will enable interoperability and cooperation within the national and international environments.
4.2.8	Military education and training capabilities
Their proper integration  into the civilian education system will be ensured to support the development of military knowledge and science for the needs of the Slovenian Armed Forces.
Military education and training capabilities will be developed and upgraded in line with changes in society, technological advances, the development of the military profession, and lessons learned in contemporary armed conflicts.
Particular attention will be devoted to the development of the combat character and organizational culture of the Slovenian Armed Forces, to leadership skills, and the professionalism and morale of members.
An important mission and objective of military education and training will be to provide members of  the Slovenian Armed Forces with an appropriate level of knowledge and competence, and thus ensure their competitiveness in the civilian environment, especially after the end of their military careers.
Basic military training will take place in the Republic of Slovenia.
There will be more specialist military education and training for the needs  of branches and services, more functional and joint training and practice, and more joint tactical exercises, including tactical live-fire exercises.
The Slovenian Armed Forces will also use the infrastructure of the Alliance member states and partner countries abroad for their training.
The construction of infrastructure, equipment and facilities for communication and command support will continue.
Telecommunication and optical networks will be upgraded, modernized and adapted.
In pursuing the long-term target size and structure of the Slovenian Armed Forces within the framework of recasting development guidance and planning documents, it will be necessary for it to be based on the real situation and circumstances under which the defence system and the Slovenian Armed Forces operate now and will operate in the future.
In order to achieve the long-term target size and structure of the Slovenian Armed Forces, it will be necessary to implement measures to successfully address both wider demographic trends and the decline in the population who have completed military service or have fundamental military knowledge, who represent an important resource of personnel for completing the active component and, even more so, the contract reserve component and  the military strategic reserve.
2020	2025	2030	2035
The military capabilities of the Republic of Slovenia will be increased through the military strategic reserve in the event of an imminent risk of an attack against the state or the declaration of a state of emergency or war.
The Slovenian Armed Forces will be organized at strategic, operational and tactical levels.
STRATEGIC	GENERAL STAFF OF THE SAF LEVEL
Armed Forces
If other components of military service which would significantly increase the planned target size of the Slovenian Armed Forces are to be activated, the possibility of establishing additional commands at the operational level will be examined, if need be.
The support part of the Slovenian Armed Forces will be responsible for the maintenance of technical goods, equipment and weapons.
The units of the Slovenian Armed Forces intended for combat, combat support, combat service support and command support will consist of the active component and the manoeuvre contract reserve component, and will be organized as battalions or regiments.
The military territorial commands will be manned by the active component and the territorial contract reserve component at the regiment and brigade levels.
The proportion of deployable forces of the SAF land component will be 50%, meaning that up to 50% of the SAF land component will be organized, equipped and trained for operations outside national territory.
Improved implementation of strategic communication, the promotion of the military profession, and the increase in the territorial part of the Slovenian Armed Forces will contribute to a better integration of the defence system  into the local environment and to permanent close contacts with the citizens.
Only by making these investments will the Republic of Slovenia be able to ensure an appropriate level of preparedness of the defence system in the future, and to meet all its obligations related to common defence arising from its membership in NATO and the European Union.
At the same time, the NATO member states will increase their defence spending on major equipment and on research and development, with the aim of allocating at least 20% of their defence spending for these purposes within the next decade.
For national defence purposes, it is necessary to provide financial resources in the long term, which will enable the implementation of the development objectives of the Slovenian Armed Forces as laid down in national strategic and development guidance documents, including the development of defined capabilities and an increased number of Slovenian Armed Forces personnel  in the event of a sharp deterioration in the security situation.
Rational and sustainable defence expenditure able to effectively support the development objectives in this document and at the same time follow the Defence Investment Pledge, should gradually increase to at least 1.5% of GDP in 2024.
CIVIL DEFENCE AS A RESILIENCE BUILDING BLOCK OF THE STATE AND SOCIETY
In terms of the enhancement of civil preparedness and the resilience of the state, the defence planning entities in the state will, through activities and measures, ensure civilian capabilities for Host Nation Support; the strengthening of resilience to hybrid threats; the protection and resilience of critical infrastructure, information and communication support; geospatial and cartographic support; and the implementation of military duties and of material and medical care.
Here, constant inter-ministerial cooperation, responsibility, and the appropria- te organization of entities responsible for planning will be taken into account for the performance of tasks in crisis, emergency and war, in accordance with
international obligations and the ability to adapt to change.
Under changed circumstances, the most important function of the Ministry of Defence will be the coordination of tasks in the field of defence at both the regional and local levels.
Simplified procedures for border crossings under military mobility will be in line with solutions in the European Union and NATO, and efforts should be made to synchronize and complement different procedures.
One particular challenge for the state’s defence is hybrid threats, whose negative effects have significantly magnified due to the development  and use of new technologies and the coordinated operation of various actors.
In carrying out activities to strengthen civil preparedness and adopt appropriate national solutions, vulnerability will be reduced and resilience to hybrid threats improved.
The defence system in cyberspace follows the norms and rules of operations in accordance with international law.
The most important objective of the establishment of the capabilities of the defence system’s communication and information system will be to ensure adaptability and interoperability of timely, accurate and comprehensive data in real time which are necessary for the effectiveness of the defence system and the performance of military operations
Intensive and systematic training, education and exercises in the area  of cyber security will contribute to raising awareness of cyber threats, acquiring knowledge, and developing trust both  at  the  national  level and within the Alliance.
A comprehensive range of functionalities  to ensure  cyber  security,  encompassing  defence,  prevention,  assessment, sustainability, and notification, will be set up in accordance with the national policy, and the policies of NATO and the European Union.
The integration of intelligence and security processes, and their technological and personnel capabilities will be reasonably strengthened, which will enable successful and timely detection of individual threats.
Individual entities of the intelligence and security community in the Republic of Slovenia will continue to cooperate in the exchange of data, capabilities, and expertise.
In addition, cooperation with the partner intelligence and security services of the member states of the European Union and NATO, and with other countries, if required, will continue in the exchange of data and experience.
In addition to the development of traditional intelligence and security capabi- lities, with a focus on counter-intelligence activities, cyber, technological,  and other support capabilities will be developed, which will enable successful counteracting of threats.
In an increasingly complex, highly developed, and dynamic information environment, we are faced with continual information flow, a global audience,  information overload, fake news, and social media.
Strategic communication also actively contributes to the limi- tation and reduction of the effects of contemporary security risks and threats.
The adaptation and responsiveness of the defence system to the changing security environment requires the relevant placement and use of various elements of the concept of strategic communication, which will at the same time follow the concepts and guidelines of NATO and the European Union.
In doing this, a fundamental principle of strategic communication will be followed, i.e. a consistency between the messages and the activities carried out.
To establish mechanisms providing the conditions for an increase in defence forces to successfully implement the Doctrine of Military Strategic Reserve of the Republic of Slovenia in the event of a sharp deterioration in the security situation or an immediate military threat to the Republic of Slovenia.
To implement solutions regarding the territorial organization of the Slovenian Armed Forces, and to ensure their greater involvement in and connection to the local environment in the wider territory of the Republic of Slovenia.
To ensure situational awareness and to provide an analytical  assessment  of  hybrid  threats  in  support  of  the  decision-making
To prepare legislative solutions for the implementation of key equipping projects of the Slovenian Armed Forces.
To review and update normative solutions related to intelligence and security activities in the field of defence, and to integrate intelligence and security capabilities and processes.
CONCLUSION
The defence system of the Republic of Slovenia will pursue an intermedia- te defence spending target of 1.5% of GDP by 2024 within broad fiscal frameworks, and a gradual long-term approximation to the defence spending target of 2% of GDP.
The recommendations in the Defence White Paper of the Republic of Slovenia will be the basis of the preparation of new normative, development guidance and planning documents, such as the defence strategy, the Resolution on the General Long-Term Development and Equipping Programme of the Slovenian Armed Forces, and medium-term  defence  programmes,  which  will  define,  on the basis of realistic assumptions, how intermediate targets in the development of the defence system capabilities will be achieved in reaching the desired state by 2035.
Building defence capabilities will be a gradual and long-term process requiring constant political support, stable long-term funding and a relevant normative framework.
Through an effective, modern, and responsive defence system, the Republic  of Slovenia will ensure security to its citizens as a condition for the functioning of other social subsystems, and contribute to a quality living environment for the development and perspective of all generations.

THE CIVIL DEFENCE DOCTRINE OF THE
4.3 Obligations and responsibilities within civil defence
7 CIVIL DEFENCE PREPARATIONS FOR EMERGENCIES AND STATES OF WAR , CRISES AND MARKET DISRUPTIONS
7.1 Measures taken by state agencies and agencies of local self-administration for operation during war
8 CONCLUSION
The Doctrine signifies the realisation of defence strategy because it defines the principles and processes for attaining the goals of national security and defence .
On the one hand , the Doctrine defines the general frameworks that are the basis for the long-term organisation of civil defence in the Republic of Slovenia and , on the other hand , it embodies in concrete form the carrying out of the tasks defined in the defence strategy .
2.1 Changes in threats following the end of the Cold War
A boycott or economic blockade , even though this is unlikely under present circumstances , could have a serious effect on the Slovenian economy .
The deterioration of conditions , instability or a cessation of the peace processes in Southeast Europe could indirectly affect the Slovenian economy as well .
During a war , the enemy would attempt to disable the operation of information and communication systems , as well as means of informing the public - especially in the area of broadcasting - through powerful and organised information warfare and special warfare , including various types of psychological warfare , as well as through military actions directed against facilities . Because of their exposed nature , this would realistically result in great material damage if it were not possible to repel the threat quickly .
In addition , this would also ensure appropriate support from global public opinion .
The Republic of Slovenia is a potential goal or transit route for a large number of migrants or refugees , which could have serious humanitarian and economic consequences ;
To undertake work and material duty , as well as the carrying out of all elements of military duty , in a timely fashion .
To ensure regular and sufficient supply for the population .
To strengthen the preparedness of people for the defence of the state in war .
It is therefore necessary to formulate such measures as will be able to be used and introduced selectively and gradually in accordance with the conditions ;
Civil defence measures must be formulated in a way that they will interfere as little as possible in the freedom of economic activity and , at the same time , take into account the effectiveness of the entire economy ( the principle of proportional means ) .
4 TASKS , JURISDICTIONS AND OBLIGATIONS WITHIN CIVIL DEFENCE
4.1 Tasks of civil defence
To preserve the operation of the authorities ;
State agencies , municipalities and regions , companies , institutes and other organisations that , in accordance with legislation , carry out preparations for civil defence in the case of war may , in order to ensure the uninterrupted execution of their tasks during wartime , propose to the agency responsible for defence an arrangement of necessary workers on the basis of working duties and corresponding material resources on the basis of material obligations .
In this , of special importance is the relation between the ministries and those companies , institutes and other organisations whose activity is , according to the decision of the Government , of particular importance for defence , as well as public enterprises and institutes .
It is necessary to ensure a greater degree of mutual cooperation in the planning of tasks in the area of civil defence .
It is necessary to ensure an effective harmonisation especially through proper crisis management mechanisms and the inclusion of specialists .
As an advisory agency of the Government in the area of civil defence during peacetime , the interdepartmental coordination group for the harmonisation of civil defence preparations , which attends to the harmonisation of basic solutions in the defence plans of the Government and the ministries , harmonises issues from the area of civil defence connected to the inclusion of the Republic of Slovenia in the European Union and NATO , and in other forms of international cooperation , formulates proposals for the work programme in the area of civil defence preparations at the state level and handles the most important strategic , doctrine-related and developmental document from the area of civil defence .
The working out of defence plans and defence documents ensures preparations for the gradual , organised and harmonised switchover of state agencies , municipalities and regions , as well as specific companies , institutes and other organisations , for operation during an emergency or state of war , with the goal of ensuring the uninterrupted operation of their activities under these circumstances .
The content of defence plans and defence documents , and those responsible for working them out , is defined by legislation .
In this it is necessary to ensure that these will also be applicable for use in crises as well as market disruptions , and not only in an emergency or state of war .
The number of those responsible for working out defence plans and defence documents will not be increased .
The National Assembly carries out supervision over civil defence directly or through the competent working body , especially when requiring reports and information regarding the status of preparations for civil defence .
Within the framework of individual components , harmonisation is especially important in the area of economic and psychological defence , as well as in those areas that require a larger number of persons to implement them .
It is increasingly necessary to include scientific and research organisations in training , as well as experts from both at home and abroad .
In the case of a deterioration of security conditions and the possibility of an attack on the Republic of Slovenia , it is necessary to ensure the complete preparedness of all those conducting civil defence for operation in wartime in an adjustment period that cannot be longer that six ( 6 ) months .
Measures for preserving the continuity of the authorities are planned only for the case of war .
Preserving the functioning of the authorities throughout the entire territory of the state , including under the most difficult circumstances ;
Ensuring the conditions for the optimal use of personnel , material other capacities .
7.2 Economic defence
Regardless of the fact that the tasks of civil defence in this area are relatively new elsewhere around the world and that there is not yet sufficient experience , an appropriate concept will be prepared that will facilitate the carrying out of tasks in this area .
7.2.1.2 Logistic and other support for military defence
7.2.2.1 Trade and supply
During an emergency , a state of war or market disruptions the significance of domestic and foreign trade would significantly increase , which especially holds true for the import of basic foodstuffs and non-food products , strategic raw materials and recyclables .
It is therefore important that during peacetime the competent ministry develop proper preparations that are harmonised with other ministries .
Within this framework , state reserves of goods are of special significance .
Supply will be most effective if market rules continue to operate in the areas of prices .
Traffic activity plays an important role in the operation of economic and other activities as well as the regular supply of the population .
At the same time , the competent ministries will provide for measures to mitigate the consequences of disruptions or reductions in the volume of individual types of traffic , through detours to other means of transport , the use of bypass routes , the concluding of bilateral and multilateral international agreements with other countries on the shipping , warehousing and transit of goods , and so on .
In the area of the operation of information communication technologies , measures will be planned to ensure their operation during an emergency , a state of war and market disruptions , both within the country as well as in international trade .
Priority will be given to ensuring the operation of systems for the needs of state agencies , companies , institutes and other organisations whose activity is of particular importance for defence .
Measures will be especially planned to ensure cooperation between state agencies and the Slovenian Armed Forces .
Therefore measures will be planned for the protection of all infrastructure facilities in this area and for the protection of programmes and other tools used in this work .
The anticipated increase in reserves of petroleum and petroleum derivatives will favourably affect the preparedness of the state for operation under changed circumstances and will represent one of the most important aspects of the materialisation of civil defence in general .
The number , location and capacities of field hospitals will be defined .
On the one hand , this concerns the formation of basic reserves of medicines and medical instruments as part of the state's reserves of goods and , on the other hand , it is also necessary to carry into effect appropriate measures for the effective conduct of additional tasks for protecting health , especially during wartime .
This means that it is necessary to formulate appropriate minimal reserves of specific medical equipment for the work of health-related capacities beyond their peacetime centres of operation .
7.2.2.7 Communal and water management
The tasks in this area are highly professional and , at the same time , primarily orientational and advisory .
The principle of precise and timely information ;
Through its policy , the state must also formulate conditions for the operation of civil defence during conditions of war and , as needed , direct the carrying out of these forms of defence .
8 CONCLUSION
For the execution of the Doctrine , the necessary systemic , organisational , legal , material and other conditions will be ensured , of which the most important are ensuring the continual assessment of threats to the security of the Republic of Slovenia in the areas in which civil defence is involved , the formation of a comprehensive crisis management system , the consistent observation of deadlines for the accomplishment of tasks , ensuring financial resources and ensuring the harmonised execution of tasks with other elements of the national security system of the Republic of Slovenia , especially with military defence .
YUGOSLAVIA AT THE CROSSROADS
The principle that all Serbs needed to live in one country put great pressure on all republics with Serbian inhabitants .
This trial led to mass demonstrations and to discussions about the jurisdiction of military courts . In addition , the decision made by the Federal Secretariat for the People's Defense that trials in Slovenia could be in the Serbian language caused great dissent .
" Nova revija " was first published in the spring of 1987 . A group of people from among the Slovenian intelligentsia ( among others , France Bučar , Tine Hribar , Peter Jambrek , Jože Pučnik and Dimitrij Rupel ) published their contributions to the Slovenian National Program .
Their position was that sovereignty belonged to a nation rather than to a federation .
The movement related to a Greater Serbia was also prevalent in the Yugoslav Communist Association .
This was the first act of disobedience by the police to the Federal authorities .
The democratic opposition won the elections with 54 % of the votes .
Along with elections of delegates to the Sociopolitical Chamber , the Chamber of Associated Labor and the Chamber of Communes of the Assembly , there were also elections for the President of the Republic of Slovenia and members of the Presidency .
The RS TD HQ wanted to be informed of the quantity and types of weapons and ammunition held by the municipal and regional units and the TD Protection Brigade .
Delo , 21 May 1990
The confiscation of weapons provoked strong reactions from Slovenian politicians and the civilian public .
Urged by President Milan Kučan , General Ivan Hočevar , who was also bound by federal legislation to inform the Slovenian Presidency of the transfer of weapons , gave the unconvincing explanation that this was just a precautionary measure .
The spontaneous resistance against the illegal confiscation of weapons led to the creation of one of the best organized conspiratorial actions in recent Slovenian history , a project of the National Protection Forces called Manevrska struktura narodne zaščite ( MSNZ ) .
RECONCILIATION IN KOČEVSKI ROG
There were two units positioned there , a police logistics unit and a territorial defense protection unit .
The ceremony was attended by the highest representatives from the political and public spheres .
Despite the symbolic ritual , political differences concerning national reconciliation remained .
In the summer of 1990 , intensive intelligence activities were conducted .
THE DECLARATION OF THE SOVEREIGN STATE OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA
Secret weapon storage site in the village of Libušnje in the Tolmin municipality
In July , the National Assembly of the Republic of Slovenia adopted the Declaration on the Sovereignty of the Republic of Slovenia .
ORDINANCE ON THE USE OF THE MSNZ
Pristava nad Stično , where important documents were adopted for the further work of the MSNZ .
This was the first time the YPA was mentioned as a potential aggressor or key threat to the achievement of Slovenian independence .
At the regional level , adequate follow-up documents were written , tailor-made for the use of MSNZ units in individual regions .
The next year , many of them were used in the war for Slovenian Independence .
MSNZ ORGANIZATIONAL PRINCIPLES , REPUBLIC LEADERSHIP AND REGIONAL CHIEFS
At the level of the Republic of Slovenia , the MSNZ project was led by Janez Janša and Igor Bavčar . Tone Krkovič was tasked with operational leadership . Vinko Beznik and Jože Kolenc coordinated the activities of the MSNZ organizers and the police ( a special police unit at the regional level ) .
MSNZ unit formations were adjusted to the weapons and equipment available .
THE END OF THE MSNZ PROJECT
Ljubljana , 21 June 2000
Ljubljana , 12 May 2003
On 4 October 1990 at 2230 hours , a military police unit from the Šentvid military post broke into the Territorial Defense Headquarters located in Ljubljana at Prežihova 4.
On this occasion , Janez Slapar said , " The sooner the YPA recognizes the new TD HQ , the easier finding a solution to the conflict will be . "
During the formation in Kočevska Reka , new weapons were put on public display for the first time .
The YPA followed these events with great interest .
At the beginning of November , Slovenia was caught in heavy rains .
Floods caused substantial damage in the amount of approximately 9 billion dinars or one fourth of the Slovenian GDP .
Plebiscite ballot
The plebiscite for an independent and sovereign Slovenia was first suggested by the Slovenian Socialist Party ; the official proposal , however , was put forward by DEMOS .
The plebiscite was held on 23 December 1990 .
Out of 93.2 % of the voters , 88.5 % were in favor of independence .
In the Primorska region , the main effort was on the mobilization and movement of units and in the Dolenjska region the use of assigned units .
The exercise was observed by the leading personnel responsible for the combat readiness of the Republic of Slovenia .
The TD unit of the Dolenjska region marching through a community
This was an illustrative demonstration of offensive and defensive actions .
Soon , we were able to make use of appropriate guidelines , professional leadership , highly motivated personnel , sound logistics and a pool of experiences .
The color guard is ready .
Everything is ready for the swearing-in ceremony .
Soldiers had previously done their military service in Austria and in Yugoslavia far away from their homes and in a foreign language . When Slovenia decided on independence , it also got its own military .
180 conscripts arrived at the Ig Training Center and 120 soldiers at the Pekre Training Center near Maribor .
The YPA was ready to use firearms to complete its task .
The wheels of the YPA aggressor , an armored vehicle , took their first death toll , Josef Simčik .
At approximately 1600 hours , the first YPA tank drove into the village .
A clear message from the locals to the YPA
On 26 June 1991 at 1315 hours , based on an order by the Commander of the Rijeka Corps , General Marjan Čad , armor units left their military posts in Ilirska Bistrica and in Pivka and headed towards the Slovenian-Italian border .
The advance of the YPA was not a routine movement .
Lieutenant Colonel Tone Krkovič was in command of the honor unit of the Territorial Defense of the Republic of Slovenia .
On 26 June 1991 , a huge crowd of people from all over Slovenia gathered at the Ljubljana square , Trg republike , to attend the celebration upon the declaration of an independent and sovereign Slovenia .
The celebration at which a huge crowd of people had gathered ended with fireworks and the chiming of bells . There were also bonfires on the tops of neighboring hills .
Across Slovenia , celebrations were held but flights overhead by YPA aircraft were a bad omen .
Tank units were the most exposed YPA weapons .
Every year , the YPA had a parade as a demonstration of force .
In 1988 , the Army Command in Ljubljana was disbanded under the pretext that this measure was necessary in order to introduce modern combat principles .
The military district command was in Zagreb and it was only from there that they were able to command YPA units stationed in Slovenia .
Colonel Janez Slapar , Commander of the Republic of Slovenia TD HQ
Major Janez Lesjak , Commander of the Ljubljana Regional TD ( 5th Regional TD HQ ) from 30 June 1991
Lieutenant Colonel Vladimir Miloševič , Commander of the Vzhodnoštajerska Regional TD ( 7th Regional TD HQ )
Training for TD members was well prepared and tailored to the specific needs of TD units .
* 100 anti-tank missiles .
Igor Bavčar , Secretary of Internal Affairs , the Republic of Slovenia
A great deal of success was recorded in the other services under the Secretariat for Internal Affairs .
Kranj
There were also assumptions that the opposite side would use force in order to quash the independence process .
EOD personnel were among the busiest as they had to clear large areas of mined land as well as material left behind from the 1991 armed conflicts . The work was carried out in stages from April to July 1992 , from September to November 1992 , from April to June 1994 and from September to November 1994 .
The roadblock was made up of trucks from the Novo mesto Road Company and protected by the counter-diversion unit of the 21st District TD HQ Novo mesto .
At Trzin , three armored personnel carriers and a signals vehicle were left behind from a convoy of armored vehicles from Vrhnika .
Members of the 55th District TD HQ in Domžale , police officers from the Domžale police station and special police forces were involved in the fighting .
The rest of the YPA soldiers surrendered , and the soldiers from the YPA special operations detachment were captured the following day .
At 9 a.m. ten tanks set off from Maribor towards the Šentilj border crossing , and five tanks and ten armored vehicles started towards Dravograd .
Around noon , the barricade was fired on and later was set on fire .
Tanks and armored vehicles from Maribor approached the border crossings with Austria while the Varaždin-based tank convoy , under the command of Colonel Popov , attempted to force its way through Ormož .
The officers acted with a lot of determination and self-confidence .
YPA TANKS ON ROADS
The defense was successful and , in the evening , the column returned to Varaždin .
" According to the assessment of the Presidency , the maneuvers of YPA units-the message from the 5th military district-can be regarded as violent and ruthless actions by the Yugoslav Army , an act of aggression against the independence and sovereignty of the Republic of Slovenia and an attempt to permanently occupy Slovenia .
Slovenia will respond to this aggression by using all available means in order to protect its sovereignty .

In accordance with our plans , we increased the number of active service members and reduced the obligatory reserve . The manning of the contract reserve , however , was less satisfactory .
In 2004 , significant progress was made in improving the internal structure of SAF employees . In the future , we will try to further improve this structure by hiring additional soldiers and reducing the number of officers and non-commissioned officers .
1 KEY RESULTS IN 2004
The 1st Brigade Command commands deployable combat units , capable of operating outside Slovenia .
We carried out a national Earthquake 2004 command post exercise .
The activities conducted throughout the year , including the Earthquake 2004 exercise , demonstrated that there was a high level of readiness and responsiveness of the system to a disaster such as an earthquake . But they also highlighted shortfalls that will be remedied systematically .
In 2004 , during the Swiss Presidency of CENCOOP , the majority of issues were related to the substance , purpose and future of CENCOOP .
In the context of NATO defence planning , we prepared our first set of force goals as a
In accordance with the standing orders of the National Assembly , an official and revised version of the Law on Defence was prepared in September 2004 ( RS Official Gazette , no . 103/04 ) .
This ordinance reduced the size of defence plans in some of the Ministries and introduced a requirement that defence plans also include crisis management measures .
2.3 Military Defence
The 430th Naval Battalion , previously subordinate to the Support Command , is now subordinate to the SAF FC ; the Training Centre , previously subordinate to the SAF FC is now subordinate to the DDETC ; the Flight School from the 15th Air Force Brigade is now also under the DDETC .
This marked the transition into the period of intensive additional equipping of units , qualification training for the use of new assets and provision of conditions which are necessary to commence the training for the achievement of the planned operational capabilities .
This means more efficient combat operations , shorter response times and more time available for the preparations of missions .
We started introducing the software that supports the display of situations in accordance with NATO standards and interoperability standards that apply to military information systems . These standards were verified in the international environment and during a military exercise .
CIS users can now use improved services , have more functional software packages available and enjoy better functioning of the fixed and tactical CIS in support of commands and units at home and abroad .
PROGRESS MADE IN INDIVIDUAL AREAS OF WORK IN SLOVENIAN MOD IN 2004
The recruitment of contract reserves was focused also on the manning of other units , such as two mountain companies of the 132nd Mountain Battalion , the 9th Air Defence Battalion and the 18th NBC Defence Battalion .

They were presented the possibility of voluntary training in the SAF , participation in the contract reserve component and of a career path in the SAF .
Out of a total of 12,474 candidates , 10 , 479 , or 84 %, were present at the familiarisation . The rest of them were notified by mail .
In 2004 , the training focus was on basic military professional training of soldiers and military speciality training for NCOs and Officers .
In this way we introduced new principles for the selection of soldiers to be promoted to non-commissioned officers and certain more demanding military occupational specialities .
We also identified all details for the scope and contents of training for initial duties .
PROGRESS MADE IN INDIVIDUAL AREAS OF WORK IN SLOVENIAN MOD IN 2004
Several active service members attended basic and advanced professional military training courses at home and abroad .
SAF units regularly attended different exercises , the most important being the exercise " Leap frog " .
The troops were trained for reconnaissance and fire-fighting tasks , military police tasks and surveillance of the territory .
Civil-military cooperation in 2004 was particularly important given the changed nature of contacts with the civilian sphere because of SAF professionalisation .
The SAF participated in the SFOR ( Stabilisation Force ) peace support operation as part of the Joint Forge mission from November 1997 to the end of the operation in December 2004 .
In December 2004 , when the NATO operation in Bosnia-Herzegovina ended , a NATO HQ was formed in Sarajevo .
The mission ended in May 2004 . In October 2004 , we augmented our contingent in KFOR by deploying an MP platoon and three HQ members .
At the end of February 2004 , a SAF advance party deployed to Afghanistan to be joined by the main force in March as part of ISAF peacekeeping forces .

Other tasks are still in the process of completion .
In 2004 , the NCMC , integrating crisis management processes at the strategic level , began operating , which was an important achievement .
Materiel and medical suppor t mechanisms were put in place for the SAF and administrative communication units during mobilisation .
The Ministry of Defence participated in the implementation of the mid-term plan for the formation of commodity reserves in the period from 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2008 .
In the context of activities for the implementation of this plan , we procured the majority of the equipment for the dispensary that can take in 180 injured for the protection and rescue needs ( as a supplement of the ROLE 2 medical unit in the event of natural and other disasters ) .
It will be fully equipped by the end of February 2005 .
Spatial planning elements included in municipal plans were brought in line with compulsory defence related starting points and made sure that defence interests are taken into account in the drafting of national , regional and municipal spatial acts .
Therefore , we initiated the project for the establishment of the professional basis for the future use of defence areas by the MOD , aimed at the improvement of the information system for the defence spatial planning .
? military topographic map 1 : 50,000 ( VTK 50 ) ? 80 per cent completed
Because of extensive debates on legislative amendments for the structures involved in the system of protection against natural and other disasters , in particular among fire fighting organisations , the Slovenian Administration for Civil Protection and Disaster Relief ( ACPDR ) continued with focused effort towards proposing amendments to the Law on Protection against Natural and other Disasters , the Law on Fire Fighting and the Fire Protection Law .
the Regulation on Graphical Symbols for Fire Safety and Fire Procedures Studies , the Regulation on the Installation of Fire Extinguishers and the modified Regulation on Water Rescuers .
At the regional level , we carried out a Hazmat ? Ormož 04 exercise with the Republic of Croatia .
Research and development activities in 2004 comprised the completion of tasks deriving from tenders from the previous years and preparation of proposals for new tasks .
This was the second consecutive year in which we organised a disaster management training seminar within the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe .
Candidates passed exams for the servicing of fire extinguishers and fire safety exams .
Since this was a year of earthquake preparedness some of the children's and youth magazines published articles on this topic . A tender was given out for literary works and drawings for children entitled Earthquake ( natural and other disasters ) , and we published a didactic game and a booklet for children . On several occasions we showed a new earthquake video on TV , made arrangements for a puppet show , distributed commercial materials and had contacts with the Institute for Cultural Heritage Protection of the Republic of Slovenia .
This contributed to a better awareness of citizens , and , especially of pre-school and school children , of the dangers presented by natural and other disasters . This programme also provided lessons for better response to disasters .
There were three training sessions organised for the squad of technical divers .
Supplementary training was conducted for rescue teams for highway tunnel incidents .
The tasks agreed upon in these agreements were implemented .
There were many bilateral events with Sweden , mostly education and training events and with other Central and South Eastern European countries .
2.7 Defence inspections
Our efforts were aimed towards obtaining criteria for the conduct of inspections in accordance with NATO standards .
PROGRESS MADE IN INDIVIDUAL AREAS OF WORK IN SLOVENIAN MOD IN 2004
Furthermore , the inspections addressed arms and equipment production and trade , GIS support , cartography , spatial planning for defence needs , communication and information system and financial operations .
For several years we have been monitoring the work results of the Inspectorate by comparing the number of conducted inspections with the number of inspection days used . We have prescribed and implemented corrective measures with individual subjects of inspections .
Table 3 :
Military defence
In comparison with 2003 , the number of military defence inspections was reduced . On the other hand , the inspections were conducted in a comprehensive manner and with more inspectors .
During inspections , the inspected subjects still did not have all plans ready or they had still not been brought in line with the new legislation .
The responsibility of the Internal Auditing Service is to make sure that internal controls are in place and that the corresponding activities are being carried out .
In order to obtain the necessary clearances , the majority of employees of the ISS entitled to use secure information links received the required training .
The Central Registry premises were built and fully equipped .
New personnel were recruited and trained , and security clearances to access the classified information were obtained .
2.12 Research and development
Contacts were established with scientific and research institutions and Slovenian industry .
Solutions reached in the field of organisation contributed to the management of procedures , control and development .
As part of the TRP " Science for Security and Peace 2004 ? 2010 " , 57 contracts were signed for application-related scientific research work and five contracts for technological development , worth 2,758 million SIT .
? defence against terrorism , protection of people and the environment ,
More than ever before , much attention was dedicated to human resource management based on an active personnel policy . This represented one of the key professional areas in attaining strategic objectives in the defence area .
Recruitment of sufficient quality personnel proceeded as part of the transition process to the professional military and contract reserves .
Links were established between the internal labour market and the market within the government administration , which made the manning of individual positions possible , primarily through reassignment .
In 2004 , the number of regular troops increased by 565 persons or 8.8 %.
Table 4 :

Government employees in the administrative part of the Ministry include also 52 or 3.17 % persons performing military duties .
This number includes 105 employees who are not legally required to acquire the missing qualifications , while others need to obtain the required education by 28 June 2005 and/or 14 January 2009 at the latest .
The SAF structure in the years from 2000 to 2004 by status
As of 31 December 2004 , the SAF numbered 1,393 or 20.07 % officers ; 2,037 or 29.35 % non-commissioned officers ; 2,604 or 37.52 % soldiers ; 174 or 2.5 % civilian specialists in uniform ; and 728 or 10.49 % civilian employees .
The staff includes 813 or 11.7 % women .
The current average age of SAF service members is 35 years and has been reduced by one year compared to 2003 .
Various forms of functional training car ried out outside the Ministry involved approximately 900 employees .
Language training based on SAF standards STANAG 6001 for the acquisition of specific language skills in English , German and French is provided by the School of Foreign Languages at the DDETC .

The new system enables a better overview of the actual personnel count in individual facilities and control of movement of clients .
During the same period , administrative permits were obtained for all project-based reconstruction works .
The spatial and programme project for the construction of the post , training area and firing range at Apače planned for 2004 was also prepared and used as a basis for changes and amendments to the spatial and community plan of the Kidričevo municipality .
Supplementary documents were produced for the reconstruction project of the Brnik hangar , which is to be partially completed in 2005 .
In line with investment and maintenance projects , extensive works were carried out to meet the needs of the SAF and the administrative sector in the amount of roughly 150 million SIT . For the purpose of maintaining the installed infrastructure and improving work conditions of the personnel , regular and maintenance tasks were performed in the amount of about 100 million SIT .
76 housing units and five garages were distributed , 16 sale contracts and 39 lease contracts concluded , and 34 flats vacated .
The board in charge of managing tangible property used by the MOD , was selling real estate assets through direct sales , public auctions and tenders in the sum total of 241 million SIT .
In order to develop an adequate communications-information system and to ensure a secure communications system between NATO command structures and national authorities which were identified as two sub-objectives of the defence area , the communications-information infrastructure was set up to permit secure transmission of voice , facsimile and electronic messages among the principal authorities of the MOD , Ministry of Foreign Affairs and NATO structure as a whole .
NATO issued appropriate security clearance for the operation of this infrastructure .
The process of system upgrading was carried out in Ljubljana , Postojna , Vrhnika and at Krim . The network was additionally expanded through the DTC Poljče .
3.4 Equipping and modernisation
? continuing the equipping process for SAF service members with personal combat and protective gear ,
? building airfield infrastructure ,
After 2007 , funding projections for the equipping requirements of the SAF will rely on the regular budget .
In line with the information system development , SAF units started the introduction of the Information System for Defence and Protection Duties up to the battalion level , focusing on units manned also with contract reserves .
The project on the Information-Assisted Decision Making System initiated in 2004 will continue in 2005 as well .
The project is intended for the development and establishment of the information system which should efficiently support the decision making process within the crisis management system . It ranges from secure communications to development of elements , which help the decision makers of Slovenia during crisis .
The application software solution of the NATO codification system ( N-CORE ) was introduced into the production process .
A new personnel record system was put into full operational use as part of the information system of the human resource management ( Ministry of Finance ? unified accounting system , personnel records and labour cost ? MFERAC N4 ) , thus enabling the transition to an internally organised processing of pay and other types of personnel income at the Ministry .
The modules facilitate continuous record keeping on public tenders , invitations , contracts , and quality control of goods and services .
The government adopted a plan anticipating an increase of the SAF troops involved in these missions at the beginning of 2005 .
In cooperation with Italy and Hungary , Slovenia began creating multinational battle groups that are intended to become fully operational by 1 January 2007 .
Among other things , the conference participants decided on organising working meetings in 2005 in order to review and assess the activities accomplished , and to intensify cooperation activities as agreed with the five countries .
INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION
The multinational EU Battle Group will become fully operational on 1 January 2007 .
Representatives of the MOD were involved in the SEDM and PMSC Coordination Committees , SEESIM projects and in the South Eastern Europe defence ministerial working group addressing the issues of counter terrorism , non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and border control ( CBSC WG ) . They attended meetings of SEDM deputy Chiefs of Staff .
Cooperation continued also with the Regional Ar ms Control and Verif ication Implementation Assistance Centre ( RACVIAC ) and within the DPPI project for the representatives of URSZR .
4.5 Defence diplomacy
In 2004 , military diplomacy included ten defence attachés accredited to various countries , a defence attaché assistant , two military diplomatic representatives to OSCE , seven military diplomatic representatives and administration and technical support personnel in the Defence Department of the Permanent Mission of Slovenia to NATO .
With the exception of Iceland , Lithuania , Latvia , Estonia and Turkey , the network of Slovenian defence attachés encompassed 20 NATO member countries and 17 EU countries .
Guidelines were drafted for the activities of the military diplomatic representatives of Slovenia and criteria for the establishment of requirements and support of military diplomatic representatives .
At the press conferences held last year important projects were presented , the significance of which was confirmed by great attention and wide coverage by the mass media .
In 2004 , extensive information and briefings on this particular topic were no longer required , as they became a regular part of the updates for information services for the MOD .
The fact that the SAF and military events attract a lot of attention of the general public was also evident from a great number of visitors and public interest in the second fair Modern Military held at the end of September in Gornja Radgona .
Consequently , media coverage was more precise and comprehensive and , therefore , more than 50 % fewer explanations were requested than in the year before .
Several media questions were directed at the management and strategy of managing real estate , the process and selection of public tender participants , and the selection process for registered research projects based on the invitation for TRP titled Science for Security and Peace 2004-2010 .
Based on the analysis of our work over the past few years , we recorded a significant drop in the quantity of information and events from 2002 to 2004 , which are perceived as affairs and sources for many questions allowing , however , only little room for adequate and comprehensive answers .

Defence reforms must follow from a comprehensive analysis of all the elements related to defence and the current status of the defence system . A decision was therefore taken to conduct a Strategic Defence Review which would include long-term guidelines and a vision of the defence system up to 2015 .
The importance of the Strategic Defence Review lies in the linkage between theoretical assumptions relating to national security and defence , and practical experience .
1 Introduction
In the review we set out the long-term strategic goals , founded on national interests but balanced by membership of NATO , and the required capabilities and force structure , as well as the intermediate goals leading to their achievement .
The review is the basis for determining competencies and responsibilities in the defence system , priority activities and the resources for achieving the goals .
On the basis of the results of the Strategic Defence Review , the defence reforms carried out will include changes to the defence strategy and plans , the capabilities and structure of the SAF and the related manning , modernisation , infrastructure , doctrine and training .
The priority tasks of the SAF and its capabilities need to be determined in relation to the changes in the security environment and the availability of financial resources .
5. Participation by the SAF in international operations , particularly in crisis response operations , requires them to be operationally trained and prepared and able to make forces available . These forces must be capable of operating in joint international operations together with other armed forces .
6. In accordance with legislation , by 2003 the conscript system for manning in the SAF had already largely been replaced by professional recruitment .
2 Changes in the strategic environment
The strategic environment is characterised by a high degree of complexity , instability and changeability and a growing number of low-intensity conflicts .
As the strategic environment changes , so too does the range of military tasks undertaken by the SAF .
The living environment is a complex structure that has a decisive impact in ensuring the various aspects of security - global , international , regional , national and even individual - as it determines the possibilities for development and defines relations both in the international community as well as at the regional and national levels .
The Republic of Slovenia must therefore actively endeavour to ensure stability in the region and beyond , because stability in the regional and global economic environment has a positive impact on the country's economy .
Although extreme forms of economic threat ( boycotts , blockades , industrial sabotage ) to Slovenia on a large scale are unlikely at the present time , they nevertheless have to be prepared for .
The information technology environment is one of the fastest developing environments .
A modern information technology environment also dictates the adaptation of the armed forces and thoroughly redefines the nature of warfare .
In the forefront is the development of modern , computer-supported weapons systems and command and control systems .
Security threats today are becoming ever more unpredictable , asymmetric and trans-national .
Already they are too complex for the security and defence capabilities of individual countries .
It will supplement and enhance the effectiveness of its national security system by means of active cooperation in systems of collective security ( UN , OSCE ) and collective defence ( NATO ) and the EU , and through inclusion in regional security initiatives where appropriate .
The United Nations represents one of the foundations for the management and regulation of international political and security issues and challenges .
The UN is the only global organisation tackling security and other issues in the international community at such a high level .
Membership of the EU and NATO are of particular importance to Slovenia as they represent the strategic mechanisms for ensuring a stable and secure environment which will enable the peaceful development of the country .
Processes currently underway within the Alliance point to a determination to set up the force structure and capabilities necessary to implement the aforementioned tasks while retaining its status as a credible military force in the international environment .
In South-East Europe , despite a consolidation of the security situation , the need for active reduction and prevention of tension will continue in the future .
Incorporating the countries of East and South-East Europe into West European international economic , political-security and defence integrations will contribute to reducing instability in this region .
By continuing to make an active contribution to a normalisation of relations in the region , which is not limited solely to political and economic mechanisms but also includes a military presence , Slovenia is directly strengthening its own security position and reputation in the international community .
In the forefront now are different sources of threat which in the past were pushed into the background .
rapid reaction , i.e. the ability to react to a crisis as quickly as possible
diversity , i.e. the ability to carry out the entire range of tasks , or as full a range as possible
This will provide SAF units with greater knowledge of battlefield developments and enable simultaneous operations against the enemy .
3.1 National security policy
The national security policy is a balanced set of activities and programmes comprising , in particular , foreign , defence , economic , environmental , social and cultural policies .
preventing and tackling crises , mutual assistance in the event of natural and other disasters , and carrying out joint international humanitarian and relief activities .
3.2.1.1 United Nations
In April 2003 Slovenia signed a Memorandum of Cooperation with the Multinational United Nations Stand-by Forces High Readiness Brigade ( SHIRBRIG ) , to which it has committed a detachment of military police and appointed one officer as a non-permanent member of the command .
This comprises tasks which will enable Slovenia to make a suitable contribution to the Alliance and in connection with which NATO expects Slovenia to make further progress before it joins the Alliance .
With full membership of NATO Slovenia will introduce defence planning that is comparable with NATO defence planning .
As part of this process , a two-year national budget has already been brought in .
In agreement with the Alliance , Slovenia will also develop other capabilities : NBC defence , Host Nation Support , military police , communications and information and systems support .
By the end of 2003 arrangements were in place for personnel to have the appropriate language skills for carrying out routine work on NATO-related matters .
Slovenia's inclusion in the ESDP is one of its major foreign and security policy goals .
Slovenia favours a further strengthening of the security and defence policy of the EU because the EU can have an important influence on stability on the European continent and throughout the world .
Slovenia attributes particular importance to the strategic partnership and cooperation between the EU and NATO .
As far as membership of the EU and NATO is concerned , Slovenia does not intend to duplicate costs , capabilities or defence planning .
In the near future , Slovenia's contribution to the joint military capabilities of the EU will remain the same as its contribution to NATO , but it will increase in terms of quality in line with the progress of the professionalisation of the SAF and the implementation of defence reforms .
With accession to the EU and NATO , Slovenia recognises the importance of those countries in South-East Europe , Central Asia and the Caucasus , which are not included in other European integration processes but which are important for European security and stability , being included in the deliberation of security issues on an equal basis .
By playing an active role and supporting the democratic processes in South-East Europe , Slovenia is seeking to establish itself as a credible partner in the international community .
Ensuring a presence in the region , particularly in South-East Europe , and making a contribution to peace and stability will be key long-term elements in relation to the security of the Republic of Slovenia and the operations of the SAF .
Multinational Land Force
Slovenia's aim is for the MLF to operate under NATO as a brigade within the high readiness forces .
The Central European Nations ' Cooperation in Peace Support ( CENCOOP ) initiative was created to meet the challenges facing the international community in connection with preserving and maintaining peace , security and stability .
SEDM
The aim of RACVIAC is to promote effective implementation of weapons control agreements in the countries of South-East Europe and to reinforce trust and cooperation in the region .
3.2.1.6 Other forms of cooperation
The primary focus of these operations will continue to be oriented towards South-East Europe .
Defence planning is an integral part of the planning process with the aid of which the government can oversee and coordinate the planning , maintenance and rational use of defence resources for the development of the national defence system .
The process of defence planning begins with the setting of security goals at the national level .
In the MoD there are elements of defence planning that are not yet entirely linked in an integrated system .
3.2.4 Defence resources
This means that the SAF is becoming an important employer in the labour market .
A comprehensive personnel and career development plan and a concept for recruitment and manning in the SAF with career and contractual members have yet to be formulated .
Functional training and education have also been neglected in the administrative section of the MoD . So far there have been no serious problems in ensuring a sufficient number of quality new staff for the SAF .
Thus the share of GDP allocated to defence requirements has risen gradually from 1.21 % in 2000 to 1.39 % in 2001 , 1.49 % in 2002 and 1.52 % in 2003 .
The advantages of Euro-Atlantic integration and cooperation will also need to be fully exploited , in particular within joint planning , joint operational use of weapons systems and joint training .
4.1 Strategic environment of the Republic of Slovenia
In this case Slovenia may be confronted with a problem of refugees and violence spilling over from areas of conflict .
Other circumstances which may influence national security will be economic pressures , unbalanced economic , social and environmental development worldwide , technological development , threats to the information and communications infrastructure , terrorism , organised crime , unbalanced demographic development , migration , and natural and other disasters .
It will engage actively in international counter terrorism conventions . The Slovenian government will adopt EU and NATO measures in the fight against terrorism .
In addition , the MoD will participate in the relevant counter terrorism activities taking place in the country .
Slovenia abides by international agreements in connection with the ban on production and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and will therefore consistently monitor transfers of all types of weapons across Slovenian territory .
As far as the western Balkans are concerned , Slovenia will contribute its share to strengthening security in this region within the relevant policies of the UN , the EU , NATO , the OSCE and other organisations .
In order to further rationalise resource application we will set up a comprehensive control system by the end of 2006 which will have suitable computer support and will enable control of financial , human and material resources .
Five key operational capabilities will be developed for carrying out tasks in the defence system :
Command and control includes the ability to collect , analyse and exchange information , planning and coordination of operations and to ensure the capabilities necessary for directing forces towards fulfilment of allocated tasks .
The tasks are to ensure a system of command , communication and intelligence and to provide information .
Conduct of operations includes the capacity to use the military capabilities necessary for fulfilment of allocated tasks .
The tasks are the provision of personnel , equipment and weapons , the formulation of doctrine and force structure , the implementation of mobilisation and the conduct of defence research .
prevention of all forms of aggression and responding appropriately in the event of aggression
o Participation in international organisations ' operations :
participation in the planning , organisation and management of national defence research and technologies , and support to projects of relevant industries .
The missions and tasks of the SAF determine their size and capabilities .
The system of military education and training , together with the activities of units and commands in the structures of the Alliance , must ensure understanding and the capability for inclusion in inter-service operations .
In view of the space and the need for coordinated planning of forces and operations in the Alliance , the SAF will take account of the division of forces within the Alliance for conducting land , air and sea tasks .
The combined tactical unit at the brigade level will be capable of conducting all ground force operations as part of a higher level unit and of receiving fire support from allies .
The C2 system will be capable of integration into the sophisticated allied systems thus providing for information supremacy by combining sensors and war theatre systems as well as supporting the commanders ' process of decision-making .
The SAF structure will provide for the maintenance of the out-of-area tactical group in rotation , for which a minimum of three battalions is required .
In cooperation with allies , the SAF will provide the necessary capabilities for effective operation in the air space .
In cooperation with allies , the SAF will develop the necessary capabilities for operations on and under the sea .
The military expertise part of this training , which requires field conditions including combat use of weapons , is another question which the SAF cannot resolve by itself .
Ensuring and maintaining motivation will be a demanding task .
small-scale with a platoon level unit
The key operational capabilities are units equipped and trained to carry out dedicated tasks in a specific time period set out in the medium-term defence programme or systems which enable such an operational status to be achieved ( including the education and training system ) .
Survivability and protection of forces
Effective intelligence support
Interoperability and compatibility
To provide an appropriate C2 organisation and structure , the command capabilities will be organised in commands at strategic ( General Staff ) , operational ( division ) and tactical ( brigade ) levels .
The C2 organisation and structure will be adapted to the manning and equipment and , in particular , to the actual required operational readiness .
Other capabilities for support of operations at sea will be integrated in the above mentioned combat support units or combat service support units .
5.9 Modernisation of military capabilities
Modernisation programmes are directed towards upgrading the existing weapons and equipment of the SAF and towards developing modern technology that will enable the SAF to carry out its tasks successfully .
Combat manoeuvre
Air defence
NBC defence
Command and control support systems
Extraordinary activities will need to be cut back and unplanned tasks prevented , especially within the agreed medium-term period .
Sticking to priorities means rationalisation .
1. Top priority :
operations in alliances and collective defence ( with particular emphasis on development of a motorised battalion , a battalion combat group , an NBC defence battalion and the capability to operate within the Alliance's air defence system )
command support systems
6 Civil defence and crisis management
6.1.1 Civil defence
Civil defence is intended not only for operation in a state of emergency or war but also in crisis situations .
6.1.2 Crisis management
to complement and support the military defence of the state and SAF participation in peace support operations
Armed attack will remain the most important starting point for the planning of civil defence in the future , but in addition to the tasks connected with membership of the EU and NATO civil defence is also taking on new tasks .
But this requires greater knowledge and experience of how to act in such circumstances , which means that specialists in administration , science , economics and other areas will need to be included in these activities .
Figure 3 :
6.3 Planning assumptions
The organisation of civil defence and crisis management in Slovenia is influenced by a number of important factors , in particular the level of development already achieved , membership of NATO and the EU , the reorganisation of the public sector and local government , the transformation and professionalisation of the SAF , the changes in the requirements of its logistics , and changes in the legislation relating to particular commercial and other activities .
This will demand continuous assessment of the strategic environment and enhanced international cooperation .
detecting and preventing activities by intelligence services of military organisations and other agencies and organisations which threaten the defence interests of the state , the MoD or the SAF .
Particular attention will be paid to selection , training and responsibilities of employees in the intelligence and security field .
In the new circumstances their integration into a transparent and effective element of the defence subsystem within Slovenia's national security system is a key challenge .
8 Logistics
Logistics is an autonomous , dynamic and open subsystem which is strongly linked to its environment and to the other subsystems of the defence system .
From the point of view of resources , logistics can be viewed as one of the foundations of the defence system because efficient management of resources enables the basic functions and mission of the defence system to be carried out .
8.2 Tasks
providing general services ( administrative support , cleaning , etc.
management of movements and transport of units and other military capabilities
ensuring and managing infrastructure capabilities
providing health care
Two generic approaches ( or strategies ) are proposed as alternatives :
In this case the defence system decides on the division of the logistics system into a production logistics ( acquisition logistics ) subsystem and a consumer logistics ( operational logistics ) subsystem .
A possible alternative and a transitional strategy could be a combined approach based on a traditional division of the logistics system into a production logistics subsystem and a consumer logistics subsystem .
9 Communications and Information System
It ensures the operational functioning of information services and sufficient communications capacities at the same level of service in peacetime , a state of emergency or war , although substantial changes in the intensity of activities will occur in a state of emergency or war .
Increasingly apparent is the need for protection of the Communications and Information System against the active operation of various factors which , with integration into the NATO system , are becoming much more important .
9.2 Tasks
use of open-code solutions .
Although smaller and relatively autonomous communications and information subsystems would ensure greater strength in the overall system , the coordination and replication of data between such subsystems would require such a lot of time that near real time processing would be impossible .
Users such as military units are mobile users needing a highly diverse range of communications and information services and applications .
The communications subsystems thus included in the national defence system are technologically hybrid but compatible with NATO and international standards .
As at 31 December 2003 a total of 7,950 people were employed in the MoD , of which 6,376 ( 80 %) were in the SAF , 324 ( 4 %) in the Civil Protection and Disaster Relief Administration of the Republic of Slovenia , 67 ( 1 %) in the Inspectorate of the Republic of Slovenia for Protection Against Natural and Other Disasters , and 1,183 ( 15 %) in the organisational units of the ministry .
In accordance with the Slovenian government decision , the Ministry of Defence ( not including the SAF ) has a permitted quota of 1,621 employees in 2004 and 1,606 in 2005 .
The target ratio can be achieved by 2010 on the basis of the following measures :
appropriate personnel policy in the area of employment
10.4 Establishing a modern personnel function
Within the human resource management model , a system of individual career development will be introduced in the MoD by the end of 2004 in accordance with the needs and capacities of the system on the one hand and the need for substantive and methodological know-how and experience on the other .
a system of performance evaluation and individual career planning will be introduced for all employees in the MoD and the constituent bodies within the ministry
the rewards and motivation system will be improved with the development of standardised criteria for all employees , and mechanisms to measure productivity will be introduced
methodological orientations and tools will be prepared to support the personnel development efforts of the organisational units of the MoD and the constituent bodies within the ministry

Minister's Office
New offices will not be set up in the ministry during the transitional period .
intensification of the process of introducing information technology in the defence field .
The scale and design of the existing organisation and classification of positions within the MoD need to be gradually adapted , particularly because with Slovenia joining the EU and NATO in 2004 there are still too many unknowns in terms of the required future organisation of the MoD .
The Republic of Slovenia is planning to establish an integrated structure of defence administration which will be rational , transparent , comparable to other NATO member countries and suitable to the size of SAF .
A total of 13 defence administrations and 58 defence branches were set up .
In early 2002 phase 1 of the transformation of the administrative territorial organisation of the MoD was carried out , the purpose of which was to strengthen the area of civil protection and disaster relief within the unified departments at the level of the defence administration , to reduce the role of the defence branch with the transfer of certain areas of work to the defence administration level and to reduce the number of jobs , particularly in the technical and administrative fields .
The reorganisation , which came into force on 1 January 2003 , included a reduction in the number of defence administrations from 13 to 8 and in the number of defence branches from 58 to 24.
Before the reorganisation the defence administrations had a total of 396 employees , compared with 308 on 30 November 2003 . A substantial rationalisation of staff numbers has therefore taken place , along with a reduction in the funds , premises and other material and technical means required for the work of the defence administrations .
Previously the main task of the defence administrations in the area of civil defence was to direct and coordinate the work with the bodies responsible for defence planning .
In the area of information technology and communications a reorganisation of administrative communications is underway which , through technological modernisation and a clear definition of requirements in the area of administrative communications in the transitional period , will enable tasks to be carried out on a more rational basis .
An important part of the development of e-administration is the introduction of electronic operations , which will enable public access to the web environment ( internet ) and improved performance of a wider range of services with a smaller number of organisational units .
The main changes in the work of the defence administrations took place in the area of military affairs .
The Republic of Slovenia is setting up a responsive national security system , and within it a defence system , which will be able to adapt effectively to frequent and intensive changes in the strategic environment , ensure an appropriate level of national security and contribute to reducing the possibility of crises occurring .
We will formalise defence planning , which will link the goals and tasks with defence resources .
Modernisation and equipment programmes and research and technological development programmes will be fully in line with the long-term plan and the medium-term development programme of the defence system .
CONTENT
2.2.1 Political subsystem
2.2.4 Values subsystem
On the one hand , the Doctrine defines the general frameworks that are the basis for the long-term organisation of civil defence in the Republic of Slovenia and , on the other hand , it embodies in concrete form the carrying out of the tasks defined in the defence strategy .
In such conditions , other dangers appear that were previously unknown but , just as war , threaten contemporary states .
2.2.1 Political subsystem
Because of free access to the common European Market , the full membership of the Republic of Slovenia in the European Union will in general have a favourable effect on economic development and stability , as well as easing access to energy sources and raw materials . However , this could have negative effects in some areas , especially for agriculture .
Along with economic crises , especially in the case of economic pressures and other forms of economic warfare , the Slovenian economy could be confronted with serious difficulties .
In the case of war , economic problems would increase significantly .
With market disruptions , timely and comprehensive information would strengthen the preparedness of the population to support the efforts of the authorities to deal with such conditions , and during war this would mean support for endeavours to acquire suitable assistance for our forces and the augmenting of fighting power and morale in combating the enemy .
2.3 Following sources of thrreat
In changing conditions , taking preventative measures and forestalling the grounds for the origins of conflicts and crises is essential .
To ensure that civil defence preparations proceed from comprehensive assessments of current sources of threats to national security , which are first of all under the purview of the competent ministries .
Political or social unrest from countries in the strategic environment could also spread to the Republic of Slovenia ;
To ensure the uninterrupted operation of the system of authority throughout the entire territory of the Republic of Slovenia ;
To preserve formal and informal communication among the authorities , the media and the public ;
To strengthen the preparedness of people for the defence of the state in war .
To enable the participation of citizens in the defence of the state or in non-violent resistance to the enemy .
In the planning and carrying out of civil defence tasks , we also proceed from the following principles :
Civil defence and policy in particular areas of society must be harmonised as much as possible .
It is therefore necessary to formulate such measures as will be able to be used and introduced selectively and gradually in accordance with the conditions ;
4 TASKS , JURISDICTIONS AND OBLIGATIONS WITHIN CIVIL DEFENCE
Armed attack also represents one of the most important starting points in the future for the planning of civil defence , although civil defence is also receiving new tasks .
This demands an increased measure of knowledge and experience for dealing with these situations , which means that it is necessary to include administrative , scientific , economic and other specialists in this activity .
To supplement and support the military defence of the state and the participation of the Slovenian Armed Forces in peace support operations ;
To preserve the operation of the authorities ;
Jurisdictions in connection with the organisation of civil defence and the carrying out of its tasks arise from the constitution and are embodied in legislation .
Working duties may be introduced as a general measure or only in individual economic and other activities .
The establishment of a national crisis management centre will facilitate the carrying out of tasks at this level , especially from the aspect of the rapid and harmonised adoption of decisions and passing them along to those carrying out the tasks .
It is necessary to ensure a greater degree of mutual cooperation in the planning of tasks in the area of civil defence .
It is therefore necessary to ensure effective support for agencies of authority in the form of crisis management mechanisms with which conditions will be analysed and proposals for decisions prepared at the same time and , on the other hand , will enable the quick transmission of these decisions to those that lead and carry out of civil defence measures .
During an emergency , state of war , crises or market disruptions , this interdepartmental coordination group would be reshaped into an analysis group at the strategic level with the basic task of analysing the conditions and preparing decisions for the Government .
The working out of defence plans and defence documents ensures preparations for the gradual , organised and harmonised switchover of state agencies , municipalities and regions , as well as specific companies , institutes and other organisations , for operation during an emergency or state of war , with the goal of ensuring the uninterrupted operation of their activities under these circumstances .
Civil defence preparations must be part of the regular activity of those responsible for working out defence plans and defence documents .
Top-level and expert workers in state agencies , agencies of local self-government and companies , institutions and other organisations are therefore included in them , thereby ensuring an expert basis for the solutions planned .
In addition to this , supervision is also carried out by inspection agencies , especially the Inspectorate of the Republic of Slovenia for Defence .
For effective and successful management , and also for the carrying out of the tasks of civil defence , it is necessary to ensure a high level of training for those conducting civil defence .
In view of the fact that sources of threats have various effects on individual economic and other activities that are not of uniform significance for national security and defence , from the perspective reducing costs the carrying out of preparations for civil defence may be less intense in specific activities than in others .
Preserving the functioning of the authorities throughout the entire territory of the state , including under the most difficult circumstances ;
Ensuring the conditions for the optimal use of personnel , material other capacities .
The ministries and other state agencies are responsible during peacetime for carrying out preparations for civil defence in the activities within their jurisdiction and , in crises and a state of war or during market disruptions , also for organising and performing their tasks .
Within the framework of ensuring the continuity of the authorities during wartime , special attention will be directed to measures for the operation of information and communication systems , especially in work that relates to the realisation of tasks connected with defence and to the enforcement of the rights of citizens in relation to the state , to the rapid and secure exchange of information and to ensuring the safe work of agencies of the authorities .
These activities are also the best answer to current sources of threats , because preventative action can forestall crises or at least mitigate them .
The principle of interoperability , which means that preparations and the carrying out of tasks in this area must take place in a manner such that it is possible to ensure successful participation with the civil defence capacities of other countries that participate in the carrying out of international peacekeeping operations .
As part of working out the concept of Host Nation Support for the reception , placement and transit of alliances forces , the engagement of civil capacities will also be defined , whereby an appropriate information system will be formulated that will facilitate the carrying out of logistical supply to armed forces in the Slovenian Armed Forces and also in civil defence .
As needed , civil defence will also be included in support for units of the Slovenian Armed Forces that are participating in international peacekeeping operations .
The principle of concluding contracts , which means that that logistic supply is , as a rule , planned and carried out on the basis of concluded contracts . In a case in which the competent ministry designates a public enterprise or public institution , the founder of which is the state or a local community , for the realisation of demonstrated needs , in principle a contract will not be concluded .
7.2.2 Other preparations in the area of economic defence
Although it will not be possible to guarantee the range characteristic of normal circumstances and the supply of certain goods will be limited during an emergency , a state of war or market disruptions of a longer duration , in the initial phase of such situations general restrictions on consumption will not be planned .
In doing so , the solutions must be simple , because the very restricted time for measures does not allow complex solutions .
7.2.2.1 Trade and supply
During an emergency , a state of war or market disruptions the significance of domestic and foreign trade would significantly increase , which especially holds true for the import of basic foodstuffs and non-food products , strategic raw materials and recyclables .
Necessary measures must be planned that will ensure the increased importation of strategic articles and will enable the export of those goods that are not of strategic importance for the defence of the state and , and the same time , ensure the reduction of demand through both economic and administrative measures .
Within this framework , state reserves of goods are of special significance .
In formulating these , account must be taken of the possibility of domestic production , import , the extent of stockpiles held by producers and dealers , and also financial possibilities .
At the same time , the competent ministries will provide for measures to mitigate the consequences of disruptions or reductions in the volume of individual types of traffic , through detours to other means of transport , the use of bypass routes , the concluding of bilateral and multilateral international agreements with other countries on the shipping , warehousing and transit of goods , and so on .
7.2.2.3 Information communication technologies
The area of information communication technologies is quite vulnerable with regard to sabotage , terrorist activities and break-ins .
The regular and sufficient provision of energy is a condition for the operation of the Slovenian Armed Forces , economic and other activities , and the existence of the population .
For a reliable supply during an emergency , a state of war or market disruptions , it is necessary to increase reserves of energy sources .
7.2.2.5 Industrial and agricultural production
7.2.2.6 Health and social protection
The effective resolution of more acute health problems also demands the provision of an adequate material basis both for the increased health care needs of the population and also for carrying out additional tasks .
In the area of social protection , during an emergency or state of war there will be preserved all of those forms of social assistance and care that directly resolve social pressures and ensure the most necessary protection , maintenance and assistance for all socially threatened and unsupplied inhabitants .
The priority tasks of communal activities in an emergency or state of war will be the production and distribution of water , the treatment and disposal of wastewater , ensuring the operation of burial services and the removal and dumping of trash .
The tasks in this area are highly professional and , at the same time , primarily orientational and advisory .
The principle of precise and timely information ;
The principle of managing activities from one location ;
In this area no special preparations will be carried out .

Šentjur near Celje , the afternoon of 19 May 1990
The RS TD HQ wanted to be informed of the quantity and types of weapons and ammunition held by the municipal and regional units and the TD Protection Brigade .
This meant disarmament of the RS Territorial Defense Forces .
The first meeting of the new Slovenian National Assembly took place on 4 May 1990 .
The confiscation of weapons provoked strong reactions from Slovenian politicians and the civilian public .
The TD HQ staff found themselves in a very difficult position as the majority of them knew that the confiscation of weapons was at odds with the best interests of the Republic of Slovenia .

Gotenica , Summer 1990
In 1990 , the newly elected government decided to open Gotenica and its surroundings to the public .
Its task was to find out how much ammunition and how many weapons there were in the area of Gotenica .
The ceremony was attended by the highest representatives from the political and public spheres .
Federal authorities and some of the republics tried to force Slovenia to revoke these measures as well as the declaration of sovereignty .
They had to be very careful not to be discovered .
Tone Krkovič introduced the war plan proposal and the organizational scheme of the MSNZ .
Based on the approved Directive from the Chief of the RS National Protection for the Demonstrating , Partial or Total Use of MSNZ , the necessary working documents and charts were prepared .
This was the first time the YPA was mentioned as a potential aggressor or key threat to the achievement of Slovenian independence .
The next year , many of them were used in the war for Slovenian Independence .
MSNZ unit formations were adjusted to the weapons and equipment available .
Delo , 4 October 1990
President Milan Kučan awarded decorations to MSNZ members .
The MSNZ project is unique in Slovenian history .
Courageous actions imprinted on the history of a nation keep on living , are sacred to the values of a nation , and make new generations proud of their history .
The MSNZ project is one of these actions .
This provoked violent opposition among the YPA military leadership .
During the formation in Kočevska Reka , new weapons were put on public display for the first time .
It was learned that the Slovenian territorial defense units were armed with SAR-80 rifles and new anti-tank resources .
Open threats by the YPA motivated brigade servicemembers even more and instigated their pride as if they were aware that the new Slovenian Armed Forces were being formed .
As a consequence , some political parties introduced radical attitudes towards Yugoslavia .
The plebiscite for an independent and sovereign Slovenia was first suggested by the Slovenian Socialist Party ; the official proposal , however , was put forward by DEMOS .
Despite differing positions , it was agreed that the plebiscite would be valid and honorable for Slovenians if more than half of those who had the right to vote were in favor .
Exercise preparations
There was also a MORiS brigade participating in the exercise tasked with setting up ambushes .
The exercise started with mobilization in the Vogrsko district near Nova Gorica , followed by movement in the direction of Postojna-Sodražica-Kočevje-Trebnje , with the final destination being Šmarjeta in the Dolenjska region .
Soon , we were able to make use of appropriate guidelines , professional leadership , highly motivated personnel , sound logistics and a pool of experiences .
The color guard is ready .

The YPA was ready to use firearms to complete its task .
It used its armored vehicles and military policemen to surround the center .
Many people from Maribor also organized demonstrations to defend Slovenian independence and freedom .
On 26 June at border crossings all over Slovenia , the border entry signs were replaced with new ones saying the Republic of Slovenia .
The advance of the YPA was not a routine movement .
Members of the Territorial Defense and the police were instructed to avoid conflict and not to be the first to use force .
At 1430 hours , a young 2nd lieutenant fired at the barricade in Divača , fortunately without consequences .
Despite the problems , YPA units were quite successful in carrying out the order and occupied several border crossings with armored vehicles .
Lieutenant Colonel Tone Krkovič was in command of the honor unit of the Territorial Defense of the Republic of Slovenia .
On 26 June at 2115 hours in front of the Slovenian Parliament building , a celebration began upon the declaration of the independent and sovereign Republic of Slovenia .
THE YUGOSLAV PEOPLE'S ARMY ( YPA )
Events during the War for Slovenian Independence proved them wrong .
It had an important influence on events in Yugoslavia .
Regardless of legislation , the YPA was single minded . After the disintegration of the ZKJ ( Yugoslav Communist Party ) , its political power was enhanced with the establishment of the Communist Party - a Movement for Yugoslavia .
THE TERRITORIAL DEFENSE ( TD ) OF THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA
Lieutenant Colonel Albin Gutman , Commander of the Dolenjska TD 2nd Regional TD HQ
When declaring independence , some 20,000 of the TD wartime troops were called up into TD units .
The most important positions in the Republic TD HQ were occupied by YPA officers , with minor representation in regional and municipal HQs .
Given the amendments to the legislative basis , the entire TD-related authority was taken over by the Presidency of the Republic of Slovenia .
Pavle Čelik , M.Sc . Commander of the Slovenian Police
Dr. Darko Maver , Director of the Crime Prevention Administration
The result of this joint effort was the capture of a considerable number of YPA soldiers .
Right after receiving the information that YPA tanks had left the military post , the Republic CP HQ ( RCPHQ ) initiated its operations on Župančičeva Street in Ljubljana ; its operations proceeded without interruption until the end of the war .
In 1991 , TD forces still lacked some of the required assets and decided to make use of CP stocks , in particular generators with the capacity of 1 and 2 kW , beds , blankets , sleeping bags and other accessories .
The war situation at the CPRHQ ended with the departure of the last YPA soldier from Slovenia . This , however , did not mean the termination of activities for CP personnel .
A decision was made to set up a roadblock at Poganci on the outskirts of Novo Mesto .
A TD member responded to the fire and wounded an officer in the convoy .
At 9 a.m. ten tanks set off from Maribor towards the Šentilj border crossing , and five tanks and ten armored vehicles started towards Dravograd .
Federal police officers were deployed to border crossings .
However , Slovenia did not yield as was expected in Belgrade .
The Presidency of the Republic of Slovenia convened and , as the Supreme Commanding Authority , decided to respond to the YPA aggression with force .
It stopped on the Medvedjek slope near Trebnje where the Dolenjska TD forces had laid an ambush .
Negotiations between the TD and the YPA started ; however , there was no real success .
The situation was additionally complicated with civilian vehicles stuck on both sides of the blockade .
DAY TWO ( FRIDAY , 28 JUNE 1991 )
The YPA tank crews , who had been firing while moving , came across a roadblock built from railway cars and set up across the street . They responded with shells .
Four young people from Radgona crawled close to the column and threw Molotov cocktails at the military trucks .
The tanks rolled on . Just before half past three , the Radgona border crossing was leveled to the ground .
Around noon , YPA aircraft carried out an attack and TD positions were fired on with missiles from four MIGs and three " jastreb " assault aircraft .
" Carry out offensive activities against the occupying units and their facilities at all points where our units have a tactical advantage .
Force the enemy forces to surrender , set the shortest deadline possible and carry out operations with all available weapons .
They were fully armed and supported by 5 tanks .
As evening approached , YPA troops were asked to surrender , but YPA soldiers eventually assumed their positions and the tank crews started the tanks ' engines .
The liberation of the border crossing at Rožna Dolina had a significant effect on the further development of events in the Primorska region .
YPA soldiers attempted to attack the border crossing which was guarded by police forces as early as the evening of 27 June but without success .
Combat colors confiscated in Borovnica
The war items confiscated were considerable and included several hundred tons of explosive ordnance , infantry weapons and ammunition , and other military equipment .
Upon arrival at the national border with Italy , the TD used the remaining parts of a YPA armored unit to form the first TD armor unit , officially called TONI-55 . ( The YPA armored unit had split into two group ; one had occupied the Rožna Dolina border crossing and the other the border crossing at Vrtojba . ) .
Brod na Kolpi
At nine o'clock , there were air-raid sirens all over Slovenia .
A YPA helicopter after take-off from the Celje barracks
The firing from a machinegun of a helicopter bearing the sign of the Red Cross was directed towards Maistrova Street in Celje .
Bistrica pri Naklem
Rest
The leading YPA commands from Belgrade kept sending messages with threats and lies directed against Slovenia and its people .
The number of YPA members surrendering and deserting to the TD was rising .
On Day Six , YPA aircraft intensified their attacks on the major Slovenian transmitters .
Krakovski gozd
Finding themselves in a hopeless situation , the YPA soldiers left their armored vehicles and were captured the following day .
From the direction of Jastrebarsko , a column of 20 tanks set off in order to unblock the column located at the Krakovski gozd .
The first attack on the Kum transmitter was conducted on Friday , 28 June , around 2 p.m.
The consequences were grave .
One of the planes was hit .
Škofije , 3 July , 9 p.m.
An armored division from the national guard , one of the elite units , left Belgrade in the direction of Slovenia . The majority of vehicles , however , had to stop along the road because of breakdowns . The march to Slovenia was a complete failure .
Information was received from Rome that the Italian Army had deployed a few dozen tanks along its border with Slovenia .
First , they landed on Rogla and then proceeded in the direction of Golte on 9 July , but for security reasons they had to move to Smrekovec .
