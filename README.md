# Machine translator

This is the repository of a Machine Translation project made for the Natural Language Processing course. It contains used python scripts, python notebooks and results of the quality of translations.

## Instructions

We would recommand using the machine_translation.ipynb file in Google Colab. The file is structured in a way that will guide you through the whole process of machine translation, starting with setting up the evironment, building the vocabulary out of the corpora, training the model and finally translating texts of choice.
